Helloï¼Œ everyoneã€‚ This is Mattã€‚ And let me welcome you to the Red Hat certifiedt engineer for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 courseã€‚

 And in this videoï¼Œ I'm going to talk a little bit about the course and what you can expectã€‚

 So let's go ahead and click on introduction here in our diagramã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And that's going to bring us to the section on about the courseã€‚

So this course is designed to prepare you to sit and pass the Red Hat Certified Engineer examã€‚

 which is EX294ã€‚As of the creation of this courseï¼Œ there are two versions of the Red Hat Certified Engineer examã€‚

 one is for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7ï¼Œ which is the EX 300ã€‚

 and the other is for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8ï¼Œ which is EX 294ã€‚

And this course was created based on the objectives for the Rail 8 version of the examã€‚

 which as I said beforeï¼Œ is E X 294ã€‚ So I just wanted to make sure that there is no confusion about what this course is going to coverã€‚

 So if you're interested in studying about the REil 7 version of this courseã€‚

 please check out the previous version on Linux Academyã€‚

 But if you're looking for the Rail 8 versionï¼Œ you've come to the right placeã€‚

 This diagram that you see here on the right side of the screen is going to be used as a reference point throughout the course and can also be used as a study guide as you prepare for the examã€‚

 So as we go through the materialï¼Œ you will become very familiar with this diagramã€‚

 and then you can also use it to study for particular sectionsã€‚

Another quick note is that this course was split up between me and another training architectã€‚

 which is Rob Martyï¼Œ and Rob is going to be handling all the labs for the course and I will be teaching all the lessonsã€‚

We really do appreciate your interest in the courseã€‚

 and we look forward to working through the material togetherã€‚ Nowï¼Œ before we finish this videoã€‚

 I wanted to briefly go over the subjects that we're going to be covering and make one recommendationã€‚

 So let's head down here and click back to mainã€‚ and the recommendation that I wanted to make is before or after Section 3ã€‚

 which is understanding the core components of Ansibleã€‚ I suggest that you jump ahead to Section 13ã€‚

ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And watch all the videos on ansciible documentation that way you can have a better understanding of the ansible documentation as you're going through the course and also taking your labsã€‚

Let's go ahead and jump back to the previous sectionã€‚

 and so our first main content section is going to be basic red Ha certified administrator skillsã€‚

And this is just going to be a refresh of some of the things that you learn in the RHCSA that the exam objectives of the RHCE suggest that you should knowã€‚

Then we're going to move into core components of Ansibleã€‚

 which is going to help you learn about the various components that make up ansibleã€‚

 And next we'll walk through installing and configuring our control node and then also configuring our managed nodesã€‚

 Then we'll talk about creating simple shell scripts and also how we can run ansible commands within these scriptsã€‚

 and then we'll move on to the bread and butter of ansibleï¼Œ which is creating plays and playbooksã€‚

And then in section 8ï¼Œ we're going to go over several different modules that are going to help us in automating system administration tasksã€‚

 Nowï¼Œ let's go ahead and click on next sectionsã€‚And in section 9ã€‚

 we're going to learn about using templates in Ansibleï¼Œ followed by creating and using rolesã€‚

 and then next we have managing parallelismï¼Œ and then in section 12ã€‚

 we'll talk about protecting sensitive data in our playbooks using Ansible Vaultã€‚

And then the last main content sectionï¼Œ which we already referenced is going to cover ansible documentationã€‚

 but againï¼Œ I recommend that you go through this before or after section 3ã€‚Wellã€‚

 that's going to finish up this introduction videoã€‚

 so let's go ahead and market Comp and we can move on to the next sectionã€‚
