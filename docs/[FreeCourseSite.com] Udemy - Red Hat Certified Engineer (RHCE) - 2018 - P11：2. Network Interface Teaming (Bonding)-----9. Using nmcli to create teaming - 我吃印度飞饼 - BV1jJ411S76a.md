OkayÔºå so one last thing before we end this course is you can use NMCLIÔºå which is network Manager CLI„ÄÇ

Tool to create teaming alsoÔºå and you can add Team0 interface with IP address and a gateway„ÄÇ

 So we're going to do this in just one command lineÔºå So N MC CI„ÄÇAnd M Ci„ÄÇCarhan„ÄÇAddd„ÄÇType„ÄÇTim„ÄÇKan„ÄÇ

Name„ÄÇTeam 0„ÄÇIf name„ÄÇIFC of G„ÄÇTam zero„ÄÇIP 4„ÄÇ1Ôºå92 dot 1Ôºå68Ôºå dot 1Ôºå22 dot 1Ôºå20„ÄÇ

And then the gateway configuration is going to be„ÄÇG W 4„ÄÇOne nightÔºå2 do„ÄÇ1Ôºå68 dot 1Ôºå22Ôºå dot 1„ÄÇ

Is giving me a warning because I have already added Team0Ôºå but is still successfully added it„ÄÇ

 so the proper way to do it is to remove the one I added previously and then added from NMCLI„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 now we're going to add the two interfaces„ÄÇN MÔºå CÔºå LÔºå I conÔºå add type„ÄÇÂê¨„ÄÇTeam hyphen slave„ÄÇKhan„ÄÇNam„ÄÇ

Team 0„ÄÇCase can successfully addÔºå but it gave me a reference again that„ÄÇ

I need to remove the previous oneÔºå and here I'm going to just change this to8„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇüòîÔºåChange this to 8„ÄÇ

And let me see if I need to change anything else on this„ÄÇThing rest„ÄÇAll looks good„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå this one is created as well„ÄÇSo this command added the two interfaces as slaves to team zero„ÄÇ

And the file E I F C H GÔºå EÔºå N P S 0 S 3 and 0 S 8„ÄÇAnd they are in the specific folder„ÄÇ

 the scripts folder that we are in right now„ÄÇ

So this is how you can either configure bonding or you can configure teaming„ÄÇ

Which is a new thing starting from centos 7 and RL 7Ôºå so you have now you have a choice„ÄÇ

 but the bond configuration is going to be deprecated eventually and so it's a good idea to use the team D demon and use the teaming configuration from here on„ÄÇ

Thank you„ÄÇ
