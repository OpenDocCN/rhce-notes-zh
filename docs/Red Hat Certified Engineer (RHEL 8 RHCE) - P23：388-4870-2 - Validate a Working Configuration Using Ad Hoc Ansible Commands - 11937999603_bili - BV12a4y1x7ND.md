# Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHEL 8 RHCE) - P23ï¼š388-4870-2 - Validate a Working Configuration Using Ad Hoc Ansible Commands - 11937999603_bili - BV12a4y1x7ND

Welcome back everyoneï¼Œ this is Matt and in this video we're going to be validating our working ansipible configuration using some ansible ad hoc commandsã€‚

So let's head over to section 5ï¼Œ which is configure ansible manage nodes and then down to validate a working configurationã€‚

 And before we get into validating our setupï¼Œ firstã€‚

 let's talk a little bit about the ansible ad hoc commandã€‚ And as you can seeã€‚

 the syntax is going to take the following formatã€‚ It's going to be the ansible command followed by the host or group that you're wanting to referenceã€‚

 And then you can pass the dash i flagï¼Œ which allows you to specify an inventory fileã€‚

 Otherwise it's going to use the defaultã€‚ and then you can use dash M followed by a moduleã€‚



![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_1.png)

And then dash A in the arguments for that moduleã€‚ And so an ansible ad hoc command is basically used to execute a quick one linerã€‚

 And this is going to be very similar to the way in which you would use a bash1 liner commandã€‚

 as opposed to writing a bash script that you might save for regular executionã€‚This doesn't meanã€‚

 howeverï¼Œ that you shouldn't save a list of ansible ad hoc commands that you regularly useã€‚

And in factï¼Œ we're going to be going over how to use a shell script in order to call some of these antsible ad hoc commandsã€‚

They are useful for nonrout tasksï¼Œ and we know that the main bread and butter of ansible is in the playbooksã€‚

 which is going to allow you to execute a series of plays in order to achieve a desired end state on a hostã€‚

 Howeverï¼Œ there are several situationsï¼Œ especially when it comes to non routineout task where it doesn't really make sense to write a playbookã€‚

 and it's actually more efficient just to use an ad hoc commandã€‚As we saw in the syntaxã€‚

 ad hoc commands are executed using the Ansible commandï¼Œ and then of courseã€‚

 Ansible Dash playbook is going to be used to execute a playbookã€‚

Arguments that are passed using the dash a flag do require double quotes and are going to be space delimited if there are multiple argumentsã€‚

 Another thing to keep in mind is that commands are executed as the user running ansibleã€‚

 So whatever user that you are when you run the ansible command is a user that's going to be executing the task that you want to performã€‚

You can always change that user by specifying the dash U optionã€‚

 which is going to change the user that is running the Ansible commandã€‚

And you can also use dash dashash becomecom dashash userã€‚

 and that's going to specify the user that you want to execute the commands on the remote host or manage nodesã€‚

And another important flag is the dash B optionï¼Œ and this is used to execute commands as the route userã€‚

 and this will be necessary for any task you're trying to perform on your managed node that's going to require escalated privilegesã€‚

 And this is the reason behind adding the cloud user to the suitorous file on our managed nodesã€‚

Lastlyï¼Œ the dash A option may be used without the dashM option in order to just run Shell commandsã€‚

So if you simply just need to run a random shell commandã€‚

 you can do this by specifying that dash a optionï¼Œ againã€‚

 make sure that the module option is not presentï¼Œ and then your command is going to go in the double quotes where your arguments normally would goã€‚

 and I'm going to be showing you an example of this momentarilyã€‚All rightã€‚

 so now let's head to the next pageã€‚We can talk about some of the common uses of ansible ad hoc commandsã€‚

First is file transferï¼Œ and this is useful in case you need to just copy a file to one of your managed nodes or even create a file on that nodeã€‚

Then we have package managementï¼Œ and if the particular software needs to constantly live on the hostã€‚

 then you may want to think about putting it into a playbookã€‚

 but you can still always use ansible ad hoc to install packages with yM or with apt and you can also gain information about packages that are already installed and that can be things like what's the version of the package that's installed or even if the package just existsã€‚

 and this actually speaks to a larger point of something that's useful about ansible ad hoc and that's just gaining information about a hostã€‚

Next is user and group managementï¼Œ so you can add or remove groups and users on the host as well as changing permissions on files and directoriesã€‚

 and though this can be done in a playbookï¼Œ that's also something you can do in a one- off situation using Ansible ad hocã€‚

Nextï¼Œ we have managing servicesã€‚And you could be in a situation where you just need to shut down a service or to check and see whether a service is enabled and runningã€‚

 or maybe you're even in a situation where you're going to go out of town for a weekã€‚

 So you want to issue a command to shut down all of your lab serversï¼Œ So there areï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 several different scenariosï¼Œ but that information gathering isï¼Œ againï¼Œ really importantã€‚

 which actually brings us to our next pointï¼Œ which is fat gatheringã€‚

So one of the great things that Ansible does by default is gathering a ton of different information about the hostã€‚

 such as the operating systemï¼Œ kernel versionï¼Œ even the actual disks that are attached to itã€‚

And this is what is known as ansible factsã€‚ So with the ad hoc commandã€‚

 you can actually use the setup module in order to gather these facts about a host machine or a group of hostã€‚

 and we're going to go much deeper into ansible facts later on in the course and also how we can use them in our commands and our playbooksã€‚

And then in addition to Ansible factsï¼Œ we also have general system and process informationã€‚

So this is going to be things that Ansible is not going to gather by default using Ansible factsã€‚

 which could be things like running processes or logs or even a resource utilizationã€‚

 which of course can be very important to know in a one off situationã€‚Nextã€‚

 we have software deployment from Gitï¼Œ and as you knowã€‚

 Git has become a very important part of the IT pipelineã€‚

 and there's actually a git module that's going to allow you to deploy software or files straight from a Git repositoryã€‚

And then lastlyï¼Œ playbook creation testingã€‚So using ansible ad hoc commands is one of the best ways to play around with different ansible modules and also to see how they workã€‚

 and this is going to allow you to test out the modules before you add them into your playbook just to make sure that you're getting the intended resultsã€‚

And this is actually something that I've used personally just to help me understand modules better and also just to test them out to make sure that they function in the way that I think they're going to So that's definitely something that I would recommend you do as you're learning more about Ansibleã€‚

All rightï¼Œ so now that we have learned about ansible ad hoc commandsã€‚

 we're finally coming to the moment where we can validate our configurationã€‚

 So let's head over to the command lineã€‚ Currently I am in the cloud user' home directoryã€‚

 So let's Cd into Ansibleï¼Œ which isï¼Œ of courseï¼Œ our main working directoryã€‚

 We see our ansible configuration file and our inventory directory in our roles directoryã€‚

 And before we test out any commandsï¼Œ let's go ahead and check out our inventory fileã€‚

 which is M do I and Iã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒAnd we see that we have five different servers configured Ms Pearson 2 all the way to MParson 6 So let's close out of this and we can go ahead and run some commandsã€‚

 And the first thing that we're going to do is use the ping moduleã€‚

 and that's just going to see if we can actually reach out to the hostã€‚So for thatã€‚

 we're going to run ansible Iï¼Œ then we're going to specify our inventory fileã€‚

 and then I'm going to use the default group of allã€‚

 and that way it's going to run this ping against all the hosts that are in our inventoryã€‚

And you can specify your host or group of hosts before the inventory fileã€‚

 and you'll probably see me do this both waysï¼Œ but I just wanted to point that out real quickã€‚

And then we're going to supply our dash in flag for the moduleã€‚

 we're going to be using the Ping moduleã€‚So as you can seeï¼Œ we're greeted with this green textã€‚

 as well as several success messagesã€‚

![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_3.png)

Then we see all our different managed nodesã€‚

![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_5.png)

And we were able to reach out using Pingã€‚Now I'd like to test out the setup moduleã€‚

 so let's go ahead and clear this outï¼Œ and then we can use the setup module to gather facts about a hostã€‚

 and let's go ahead and run this against M Pearson 2ã€‚

We're going to use ansible and here I'll specify the host before this timeã€‚Dash eyeã€‚Inventoryã€‚

And thenï¼Œ set upã€‚

![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_7.png)

And by defaultï¼Œ this is going to return all the facts on the hostã€‚

But the other thing that this showed is that we were able to reach out and gather these factsã€‚

 But as you can seeï¼Œ there's a ton of different facts that Ansipple is going to gather about a hostã€‚



![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_9.png)

![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_10.png)

See a Mac addressï¼Œ and this is all for our IPV6ï¼Œ and then we have our IPV4 addressesã€‚



![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_12.png)

As well as plenty of other information about the hostã€‚



![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_14.png)

So we'll head back down to the bottomï¼Œ let's go ahead and clear this outã€‚

And then I also wanted to show you that because we're inã€‚Our working directoryã€‚

 and we have our ansible dot CFfgã€‚We actually already have a default inventory file definedã€‚

 and that is our inventory dotã€‚I and Iã€‚So we don't actually have to use the dash i flag to specify the inventoryã€‚

So I want to go ahead and show that to you very quicklyã€‚SoLet's go ahead and run ants will againã€‚

 and we're going to specify MS Pearson 2ã€‚And againï¼Œ we're going to use the setup moduleã€‚

 And this timeï¼Œ since there's so much outputï¼Œ let's go ahead and pipe it into headã€‚

Then we'll show 20ã€‚And as you can seeï¼Œ since we have the Ansibleã€‚ CFfg in our working directoryã€‚

 it's going to reference our inventory file for us so we don't have to use the dash i flagã€‚

And in this outputï¼Œ we're able to see the beginning of the anciible factsã€‚

 So we see our IPV 4 addressesï¼Œ IPV 6 addressesï¼Œ and then also our ansible architectureã€‚

 as well as some additional informationã€‚ All rightï¼Œ let's go ahead and clear thisã€‚

 And now let's go ahead and use the copy module to see if we can copy files to our managed nodesã€‚

And the first thing I'm going to do is create a fileã€‚ We're going to call this secret fileã€‚

It's very secretã€‚We'll add a line called this is a testã€‚All rightï¼Œ let's go ahead and save thatã€‚

 I'm going to go ahead and copy this to MSParson 2ã€‚And rememberã€‚

 we don't have to specify our inventory fileã€‚We're going to be using the copy moduleã€‚

And then we also need to pass it some arguments using dash Aï¼Œ so open up a double quoteã€‚

We're going to add source and our source is homeã€‚Cloud_ userã€‚Ansible and then secret fileã€‚

And then we need to add our destinationã€‚And we're just going to put this in tempã€‚All rightã€‚

 so we get back that there was a changeã€‚ it's also going to show us some information about the fileã€‚

 as well as the modeã€‚This is our permissionsï¼Œ which is 0664ï¼Œ which is pretty default in standardã€‚

 You seeï¼Œ our destination is Temp secret fileï¼Œ and the owner is cloud userã€‚

 and it's even going to show us the Se contextã€‚All rightã€‚

 so we see that that was successful based on the outputã€‚

 but let's go ahead and run some shell commands against MS Pearson 2 in order to validate thatã€‚

So clear thisã€‚So firstï¼Œ let's go ahead and run Ansibleã€‚

we're going to be checking on MSsParson 2 because that's where we copied our fileã€‚

 and then we're going to pass dash Aã€‚And rememberï¼Œ if dash A is used without the dash M and a moduleã€‚

 it's going to allow us to run shell commandsã€‚ So let's just go ahead and open up our double quote and do an Ls dash L on tempã€‚

And it's a little bit harder to see because some of the wrapping that's going onã€‚

 but if you check right hereï¼Œ we have our secret fileã€‚

 it's also going to show us the permissions and the owner and groupã€‚And then nextã€‚

 let's go ahead and hit upã€‚And we can run cat tempã€‚Secret fileã€‚

And we see the contents of our secret fileï¼Œ which is this is a testã€‚All rightã€‚

 so we've been working a lot with MS Pearson 2ï¼Œ and the last thing that I want to do is run through those same commands we just ranã€‚

 but this time I'm going to do it to the Lab servers groupã€‚So let's go ahead and do Ansibleã€‚

Specify lab serversï¼Œ we're going to use our copy module againã€‚Rememberã€‚

 we need to specify the sourceã€‚And since the file is in my current working directoryã€‚

 I don't have to give the explicit pathï¼Œ so I'm just going to type out secret fileã€‚

And then destination equals1ã€‚Al rightï¼Œ so we see the output that we saw beforeã€‚

 except this time it's for all the servers and our lab servers groupã€‚



![](img/d0fc8bdfb111dc65b92736c77f41f818_16.png)

å—¯ã€‚And now let's go ahead and do our listingã€‚So ansible La serversã€‚Dash aã€‚I'll do LS dash Lã€‚

 and this time let's not list all the contents in the directoryï¼Œ but just the file itselfã€‚

And we say that the file is on every server and our La servers groupã€‚

And then we can also hit the up arrowã€‚And go ahead and cat out the contentsã€‚And as expectedã€‚

 we get this as a test on each managed nodeã€‚Wellï¼Œ that's going to finish up this video on validating a working configurationã€‚

 and this has been just a simple test showing you some of the different modules that you can use with the Ansible ad hoc commandã€‚

So let's go ahead and mark it complete and we can move on to the next lessonã€‚
