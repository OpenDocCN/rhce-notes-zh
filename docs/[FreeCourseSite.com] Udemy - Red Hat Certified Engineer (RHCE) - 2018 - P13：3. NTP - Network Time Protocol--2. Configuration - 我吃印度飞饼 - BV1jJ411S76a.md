OkayÔºå so now we are logged into our sentos server and we're going to start the installation„ÄÇOf NTP„ÄÇ

First thing we want to do is check the currentest status of it„ÄÇSystem CTL status„ÄÇAnd T„ÄÇPili„ÄÇAnd it'„ÄÇ

 as you can seeÔºå it's not found„ÄÇ So that means it's not installed in the system„ÄÇ

K installing it is pretty simple„ÄÇWe'll do a yum„ÄÇDash why„ÄÇInstall„ÄÇNTp„ÄÇ

We clear this„ÄÇCentos 7 comes with a package called Cony D„ÄÇ

And we don't want that to interrupt our NTP installation„ÄÇ So we want to disable that„ÄÇ So system„ÄÇC TL„ÄÇ

Stop„ÄÇChronyd dot service„ÄÇOkayÔºå that is stopped and we want to disable the service as well„ÄÇ

System CTtL„ÄÇDisable„ÄÇCrony D„ÄÇDot service„ÄÇOkayÔºå says the link has been removed„ÄÇ

Now we're going to go to the configuration file of NTPÔºå which is B I am' going to use BIM Ed„ÄÇV I am„ÄÇ

Esy„ÄÇNT P„ÄÇDoc„ÄÇCom„ÄÇAnd we're going to put the service that we need in there„ÄÇ

So I'm going to put the servers that are available on the internet right now„ÄÇ

 I am not using any internal server„ÄÇSoÔºå sentos dot„ÄÇPu„ÄÇüòîÔºåDot NTP„ÄÇtorg„ÄÇAnd use a switch called Ibu„ÄÇ

And then we'll put server number„ÄÇSecond serverÔºå but it's numbered as one„ÄÇSentosos dot„ÄÇPool dot NTP„ÄÇ

Dot org„ÄÇOkayÔºå I'm going to escape and I'll do a YY P to copy itÔºå and then„ÄÇJust change this to two„ÄÇ

Then I'll do the same thing again„ÄÇCopy this and we're going to go one more„ÄÇ

And replace this with the three„ÄÇThis is of our file„ÄÇ

The configuration file that's going to be read„ÄÇOkayÔºå now we're going to enable and start NTP„ÄÇ

The way you do it is system CTL„ÄÇStart„ÄÇNTPd„ÄÇStarted„ÄÇSystem CTL„ÄÇEnable„ÄÇNTPD„ÄÇ

So that way it will sustain even after reboot„ÄÇAnd we want to allow„ÄÇNTP in the firewall as wellÔºå so„ÄÇ

Farwall„ÄÇDash cd„ÄÇDashÔºå dashÔºå add„ÄÇDash service„ÄÇDash„ÄÇEquals Np„ÄÇDashÔºå dash„ÄÇOhÔºå I'm missing 1 D„ÄÇ

 that's why„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå that was successful„ÄÇNowÔºå since you've made a changeÔºå we're going to reload the firewall„ÄÇ
