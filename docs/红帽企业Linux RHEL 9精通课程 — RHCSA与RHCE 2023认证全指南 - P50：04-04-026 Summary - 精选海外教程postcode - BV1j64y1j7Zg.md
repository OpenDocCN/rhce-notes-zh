HelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this lessonÔºå I'm going to talk about the hierarchy structure and the directory tree in the Linux operating system„ÄÇ

In any operating systemÔºå we have directories and five systems„ÄÇFor example„ÄÇ

When we install when avering systemÔºå all directories under five systems are installed on the C drive„ÄÇ

Same thing for the operating system„ÄÇAll directories and file systems are installed on Macintosh hard drive„ÄÇ

 HoweverÔºå we can create directories and file systemÔºå either on Windows„ÄÇOr Mac operating system„ÄÇ

Most Linux distributions have similar directories and file systems„ÄÇ

All these directories and file systems are installed under the forward slash„ÄÇ

As we can see here in this diagramÔºå this is the forward slashÔºå and we call this„ÄÇ

A road directory or a road file system„ÄÇWe consider the root directory or the root file system„ÄÇ

 the top level or the parent of all the directories and the file systems at Linux„ÄÇ

We can imagine this hierarchy selection as a family tree and Linux„ÄÇ

 as we can see in this diagram the top level„ÄÇOr the parent of all the directors and the file system a Linux is the forward slash„ÄÇ

 Then whatever comes under the forward slashÔºå we consider them a children„ÄÇ

These children also are parents for other directives and fire system under them„ÄÇ

Let's see for exampleÔºå we have the slashÔºå let's start first with the slashÔºå the forward slash„ÄÇ

So the forward slashÔºå as we saidÔºå it's the root directory or the root five system„ÄÇ

 and we consider the forward slash the top level and all the directories and the file system„ÄÇ

And then it's come„ÄÇUnder the forward slash„ÄÇWe also have the slash route„ÄÇ

 we consider the slash route the home directory for the user route„ÄÇWe have the slash diff„ÄÇ

This secretary has devicesÔºå files and details about the system devices„ÄÇFor an instant„ÄÇ

Physical devices and other information about devices„ÄÇWe have also the slash home„ÄÇ

 we consider the slash homeÔºå the home directory for every user and the system„ÄÇ

All personal directs and file and so on for every user are saved„ÄÇAnd or under the slashwood„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we have Tom and MaryÔºå those two users under TomÔºå we have„ÄÇADiry documents„ÄÇ

 and we have also here a text file welcome text„ÄÇ the same thing here for Mary„ÄÇ

 we have a directory pictures„ÄÇAnd then we have photo that B B N G here„ÄÇWe have the slash temp here„ÄÇ

 as we can see„ÄÇHere in this diagramÔºå this directory basically is like a storage„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 it stores temporary files whenever we report the system„ÄÇ

 everything is going to be deleted from the slash temp„ÄÇWe have the slash ETC„ÄÇ

This directory has many directories files„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåShid scripts and programs with their configuration files that execute a Linux distribution„ÄÇ

 for an instanceÔºå BaWDÔºå groupÔºå securityÔºå FtabÔºå and Chrome tabab and so on„ÄÇ

Also here we have the slash boot„ÄÇThis circuit has boot files and information about configuration for boot files and details about kernel of the Linux distribution„ÄÇ

For instanceÔºå some of these directories and files under the slash put are grip and grip„ÄÇ

2 you can see we have the grip2 and we have the grip„ÄÇ Also we have a text file here„ÄÇ

 the grip that saves youÔºå which is the configuration file here„ÄÇ

We also has here here because you can see here in this diagramÔºå we have the slash bar„ÄÇ

This director has some data and information that most of the time„ÄÇIt changes on updates„ÄÇ

They are common directories in the slash fileÔºå for instanceÔºå logÔºå mail„ÄÇ

 S and Op file all those directories„ÄÇThe most important director inside the slash file is the log file„ÄÇ

It just slash bar slash log stores this okayÔºå this directory does slash log stores and save system log files and activities for files systems„ÄÇ

 for an instance„ÄÇBoood that logÔºå messagesÔºå yam logÔºå mail log and so on„ÄÇWe have also here the s box„ÄÇ

 this contains information about current Linux kernelÔºå for an instanceÔºå up timeÔºå devices„ÄÇ

 memory informationÔºå swapwasÔºå partitionsÔºå and CPUÔºå and un information and so on„ÄÇ

And theres also other directories and we can notice here in this diagram there are many directories under those directories I just mentioned about some of those„ÄÇ

 and we can save directors and files under these directories„ÄÇThat conclude our session„ÄÇ

 Thank you and see you in the next listen„ÄÇHello everyone in this lesson I'm going to talk about the root directory and the hierarchy of users and Linux„ÄÇ

As we can see in this diagram that there is a difference between forward slash„ÄÇAnd slash route„ÄÇ

The forward slash is the road directory or road file system„ÄÇ

And it has nothing to do with the home directory for user route„ÄÇWe can consider the forward slash„ÄÇ

Is like the top level or the parent of all the directories and file systems and Linux„ÄÇ

The home directoryÔºå the s route for userÔºå for route user comes under the„ÄÇ

Top level which is the forward slash„ÄÇSo we need to understand the difference between„ÄÇThese two terms„ÄÇ

 the forward slash„ÄÇThe root directory or root file system and the home directory for user root„ÄÇ

 So they slash route„ÄÇSo we can see here we can save files and directories under the slash route„ÄÇ

Every user in Linux system has its home directoryÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇFor example„ÄÇ

 we have Tom Mary John„ÄÇThese three users„ÄÇüòÆÔºåWe can save„ÄÇ

Personal files and directories under these directories„ÄÇAnd the same thing hereÔºå we can see here„ÄÇ

 this is the„ÄÇThe route or the home directory for use the route„ÄÇ

And we can save also files and directories under the s shot„ÄÇSo what is the root userÔºü

Is the sober user in the system that has full refreshleesÔºå for exampleÔºå modifying and installing„ÄÇ

 deletingÔºå adding users and so on„ÄÇ BasicallyÔºå we consider the root user„ÄÇIs like the admin„ÄÇ

The manager of the system„ÄÇIt has a full control of the system and all over the users in the system„ÄÇü§¢„ÄÇ

We can see also hereÔºå we have„ÄÇ3 usersÔºå we have Tom Mary Jon„ÄÇ

These users have directories under their home directory„ÄÇ

 so this is what we are going to say that what is the bath of this user is a slash home slash Tomm„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå and slash theto and would be the same thing for Mary and John„ÄÇIf a user can access„ÄÇ

Their home directory„ÄÇForExampÔºå Tom can access his own directory„ÄÇMarary the same can„ÄÇ

 she can access her own directory and the same thing for Jean„ÄÇHowever„ÄÇ

 these users can access other users directly except the userÔºå unless if somebodyÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 Mary gives a permission to Tom to access her home directlyy„ÄÇBut for the route you„ÄÇ

The root user doesn't need to get any access„ÄÇ The root user have a full control of this„ÄÇ

Users are all the directories system and the fire System Atlantic„ÄÇ

So we need to understand between the root users and the order users on the system„ÄÇ

That's it for decision sessionÔºå thank you and see you in the next listen„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇ

In this lessonÔºå I'm going to talk about the absolute bath and the relative path„ÄÇAlso„ÄÇ

 I'm going to talk about the command options and arguments„ÄÇL Linux„ÄÇ

We have two different types of bathing„ÄÇWe have the absolute pathÔºå and we have the relative path„ÄÇ

In absolute pathÔºå we have to write the complete path„ÄÇAnd alsoÔºå we have to start the bathing from„ÄÇ

The route directoryÔºå the forward slashÔºå then well continue writing the the name of the directories and we separate them„ÄÇ

By typing the slashÔºå So you can see here in this example„ÄÇ

 So this is the command Cd we want to change„ÄÇThe current directory in order to go to the directory„ÄÇ

Dsive„ÄÇSo you can see here this is the forward slash„ÄÇ This is the root directory„ÄÇ

 Then this is the directory hall slash to„ÄÇ So we separate between the directories by typing the slash„ÄÇ

Then slash LFC C SÔºå then slash test„ÄÇSo this is the way how we write the absolute bath„ÄÇ

We can go now to the relative path„ÄÇThe ri bath is basically defined as a short bath„ÄÇ

As we already inside the directory„ÄÇOr the working directory„ÄÇ

 We don't start the bath from the road directoryÔºå the forward slash„ÄÇ for exampleÔºå we can see here„ÄÇ

 We are already„ÄÇInside„ÄÇThe current working directory„ÄÇ

 And we would like only just to go to the next directory so we don't have to„ÄÇRight the complete path„ÄÇ

So this is the relative path„ÄÇ Its short„ÄÇ We just„ÄÇAgainÔºå I just change the current path„ÄÇTo the next„ÄÇ

But here„ÄÇWe have for the absolute path„ÄÇ we write the complete path from the beginning„ÄÇT that„ÄÇ

Majority of the commands usually have optionsÔºå and we run these options after the commentss„ÄÇ

We can write or run these options either as a short not or a long not„ÄÇ So as we can see here„ÄÇ

 this is the command we have L So is to list the directory contents„ÄÇ

And then we have the options on this optionÔºå either we write them as a short rotation or a long rotation„ÄÇ

 for example„ÄÇWe have the dashes„ÄÇSo we is this is the short not and we can also write the long notation dash dash size„ÄÇ

And we can see here is the argument comes after because the argument comes after the options here„ÄÇ

For an instanceÔºå we have it slash file and slashÔºå This is the we would like to list the content of what„ÄÇ

Of the row directory and here would like to list the contentÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 for the slash home sdown s LF CSs„ÄÇSo for the optionsÔºå we can write them either short notation„ÄÇ

 as we can see here or a long notation and the arguments comes after„ÄÇ

 so we just need to remember these commands„ÄÇOptionsÔºå then arguments„ÄÇ

The me reason for rewriting options and arguments after the commands„ÄÇ

Is to adjust the behavior of these command„ÄÇ ThereforeÔºå when„ÄÇ

 when we pass options and arguments to the commandÔºå for exampleÔºå here there is„ÄÇ

 we want to adjust the behavior and execution of these commands in order to receive different results„ÄÇ

That's it for this sessionÔºå thank you and see you in1 next„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this demomo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use PWD command and Cd command„ÄÇ

The PwD command is used to print the name of the current working directory„ÄÇ For example„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type PwD hit enterterÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇü§¢„ÄÇ

PWD print the name of the current work directory„ÄÇSo the current work directly„ÄÇ

 we are in slash home slash student„ÄÇGet now let's move on to the next commandÔºå the C command„ÄÇ

The C command is used to change the current of or directorÔºå for example„ÄÇI'm going to type C„ÄÇ

And already created the director's called„ÄÇDiiry oneÔºå then I hit enterÔºå so C space„ÄÇ

 then the name of the directory hit enter„ÄÇAnd I'm going to type PwD to print„ÄÇ

The name of the current working directoryÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we moved on from the previous directory„ÄÇthe world can tree„ÄÇTo the menu working directory„ÄÇ

 So we are right now in directory„ÄÇWhat„ÄÇIf I would like to change the current„ÄÇ

Dirreectory and go back to the home directory of this current user„ÄÇI'm going to type only C„ÄÇ

Then I hit enter„ÄÇThePWD is to make sure„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇWe went back to the„ÄÇPrevious director„ÄÇ

So what is this directoryÔºå a slash home slash student and what is the previous oneÔºü

So this one is the current oneÔºå the previous one we were on„ÄÇSlash home slash studio slash directchi„ÄÇ

If I would like to move on„ÄÇTwo stepsÔºå not just only to the„ÄÇNext directory is the directory after„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type C„ÄÇThen the name of the 3D CDdÔºå then spacee„ÄÇ

 then the name of the directory directory 1Ôºå then the name of the next directory directory2„ÄÇ

Then I hit enter„ÄÇAndPWD„ÄÇAnd hit enter„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we moved on two steps„ÄÇTo direct„ÄÇÂ∞±„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if i would like to change„ÄÇAnd or switch back to the directory that we were working before„ÄÇ

 also to print the current working directory„ÄÇI type the command C in space dash„ÄÇThen I hit enter„ÄÇ

As you can see here„ÄÇWe the this command prints the„ÄÇ

The working director that we were working before and also„ÄÇPrinceÔºå the current work and directory„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 let's move on„ÄÇTo change to theÔºå okayÔºå let's type BwD now just to make sure we are here in this working directory„ÄÇ

NowÔºå if I hit CdÔºå then dot„ÄÇIt's not going to change anything just it's going just to change the working directory to the current working directory„ÄÇ

NowÔºå if I would like to go back to that„ÄÇAnd move on next to like two more steps„ÄÇSo directory1„ÄÇ

 then directory2Ôºå So Cd space directory  one slash directory 2Ôºå and then I hit enter„ÄÇDWDÔºå perfect„ÄÇ

 So we'll move down two more steps„ÄÇ Now if I would like to change„ÄÇ

The directory and go back to the home directory of the current userÔºå there is another command C then„ÄÇ

Tell that„ÄÇSpace delta then I hit to enter Pw D„ÄÇ we can see over here that we went back to the„ÄÇ

Home directory of the current user„ÄÇÊù•‰ªÄ‰πàÈ•≠ÂêÉÁöÑ„ÄÇOrIf I want to move on to the next directory Cd directory one and I hit enter„ÄÇ

NowÔºå if I would like to change the directory and go back one more step to the previous directory„ÄÇ

 I can type the command Cd and dot dot„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåAnd I hit entered„ÄÇD Wg„ÄÇWe can see over here„ÄÇ

 we went back to the home Ja„ÄÇOf the current user„ÄÇIf I want to go back right now„ÄÇ

 thus I want to move on right now to the directory  one and directory 2 also„ÄÇ

 so two more steps then I hit entered„ÄÇThen what I'm going to do right now„ÄÇ

I would like to change and go back one more step to the previous directory also so I can do C„ÄÇ

 then dotÔºå dotÔºå then slash„ÄÇAnd I had entered„ÄÇDWg„ÄÇCan see here„ÄÇ

We went back one more step to the previous directory„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to move on„ÄÇ

 let's move on to the next oneÔºå bar 32„ÄÇPWD can see here this is the working director right now„ÄÇ

We move on to the directory too„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to go back from directory2 to just two more steps„ÄÇ

 if I would like to go back two more steps from the current directory here„ÄÇü§¢„ÄÇ

To the home director of thewahi to this one„ÄÇThere is another command we can type C„ÄÇ

 the dot dot slash dot dot slashÔºå it means that two more steps back„ÄÇThen I hit entered„ÄÇ

You can P WD and I hit entered„ÄÇ OkayÔºå can see over here„ÄÇ we went back to the„ÄÇ

From we went back two more steps from the current working directory„ÄÇ

To the home director of this current user„ÄÇIf we would like to get more information about these two commands„ÄÇ

 we can just type man„ÄÇThen PWD„ÄÇMan space BwDÔºå then we hit enter„ÄÇ



![](img/90a6b57aa3833574d7ddf15cf08afcd8_1.png)

So then we can find more information about this command„ÄÇ So we hit Q to go back to the„ÄÇ



![](img/90a6b57aa3833574d7ddf15cf08afcd8_3.png)

Ce to quit to go back to the„ÄÇTo the main page„ÄÇ So down we here we type also man Cd„ÄÇ

 space C has entered„ÄÇAnd I hit enter so I can see here more information about CQ to go back„ÄÇ

that's it for decisionÔºå Thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use LS command„ÄÇTo list directory contents we run the LS command„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to show a long listing format I run the option LÔºå so first I'm going to type LS„ÄÇ

 then dash L„ÄÇAnd hitch enter„ÄÇSee hereÔºå we have different output„ÄÇThen the previous output„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to pass an argument„ÄÇWith this command or it is also at the same time„ÄÇ

 I would like to show a long listing format„ÄÇ and here we have a directory one„ÄÇI would like to show„ÄÇ

The content„ÄÇAnd alsoÔºå at the same timeÔºå I would like to show a long listing format„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to hit enter„ÄÇ as we can see hereÔºå we passed an argument with this command„ÄÇ

Now if I would like to show all the heading files in the current directorory„ÄÇ

So I'm going to type Ls at the same timeÔºå I would like to show a long listing format„ÄÇ

Going to type dash LÔºå then dash aÔºå dash a„ÄÇIn order to show all the heading files in a hit entered„ÄÇ

Can we go up there„ÄÇYou see hereÔºå this is the command as as I can see here„ÄÇ

We showed all the heading files„ÄÇAnd we can see here dash a„ÄÇDoesn't„ÄÇIgnore entriesÔºå searching„ÄÇ

With that or that dot„ÄÇThis is a short notationÔºå D dashhiÔºå if I would like to use„ÄÇ

The long rotation so I can type„ÄÇDash dash all„ÄÇIt gifts us the same„ÄÇÂì¶„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 let's move on now if I would like to print the size or the the allocated size of each file„ÄÇü§¢„ÄÇ

And I'll go here at the top„ÄÇAlso at the same timeÔºå I would like to show a long listing format„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type firstÔºå I'm going to type LÔºå then dash L„ÄÇDen dash is„ÄÇAnd I hit enter„ÄÇ

As we can see here„ÄÇIt shows what„ÄÇA size for each of this„ÄÇEither the directory or the file„ÄÇAlso„ÄÇ

 I can wait I can't have it this way unless dash L S„ÄÇThen at the same timeÔºå most„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use the previous„ÄÇAll option that dash in order to show all the heading files„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type a with„ÄÇThen I hit to enter„ÄÇAs you can see here„ÄÇSo in this commandÔºå what they did„ÄÇ

I use three options„ÄÇDash L in order to show the long listing format„ÄÇ

Then dash S to print the size or to show the size and the a in order to show the heading files„ÄÇ

Let's go back here„ÄÇThere is also this is the short notation for the sizeÔºå if I would like to show„ÄÇ

Size I can just type it like that„ÄÇ that's the long notation and hit entered„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 I didnt use the dashel here„ÄÇNo glisting formatting„ÄÇ You can see here the size beside each of this„ÄÇ

 either the directory or the„ÄÇfi„ÄÇOkayÔºå now next I'm going to display the output in a human readable„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type first and clean the screen L„ÄÇDash ill„ÄÇThen S„ÄÇThen Ech„ÄÇSo the itch„ÄÇ

Is going to display the output in a humor readable„ÄÇ so as maker read it so can hit entered„ÄÇ

As we can see here„ÄÇWe have the kilopi and order that the rest of the fires doesn't have anything inside it„ÄÇ

So you can read it„ÄÇSame thing here as isÔºå if I want to write long notÔºå so it will be human„ÄÇReadable„ÄÇ

 DÔºå DÔºå human DÔºå readable„ÄÇDos too get fast„ÄÇBut noÔºå but this time I have to pass the dash estate in order to show it to us„ÄÇ

And I human readÔºå but we can see it here„ÄÇNowÔºå let's move on„ÄÇ if I would like to„ÄÇ

Refer the order with sorting around the option dash R„ÄÇ So Ls„ÄÇ

 Also at the same time I'm going to use the long list formatting L then„ÄÇoff„ÄÇ

So this one is going to reverse the ordering with sorting„ÄÇ

If I would like to sort best on the alphabet„ÄÇBy enter extensionÔºå so let's clear the screen first„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type LÔºå then dash it little listing formatting then uppercase X„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to list the subdirecties recursivelyÔºå so what I'm going to doÔºå I'm going to type L„ÄÇ

DashÔºå this is for the longneliness of money then dash„ÄÇUpper case R„ÄÇYou can see hereÔºå we list„ÄÇ

What we did„ÄÇ So this command listed the subdirectors exccursively„ÄÇ

If I would like to sort by modification time and newsest firstÔºå let's clear the screen„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type Ls„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåDash Al de no format and dash T„ÄÇHa entered„ÄÇ

So this is the option dashT is to source by modification time on the news first„ÄÇ

You can see here the date„ÄÇCan do it the same thing here if I would like to combine the two option„ÄÇ

With one dash„ÄÇG us the same output„ÄÇCleared the screen„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to use like to list entries by lines insert search of by calling„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type the LS dashÔºå and this is the list to list„ÄÇÂ∞±„ÄÇ

The formatting or the long listing formattingÔºå then after thatÔºå the dash X„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 this is the list and„ÄÇBy linesÔºå inserted by Collins„ÄÇSo„ÄÇThatest the so we gonna be by Cols„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to use the dash you with the dash L E„ÄÇIn order to source by and show access time„ÄÇ

So what I'm going to do„ÄÇI'm going to type LS dash U„ÄÇThen dash ill then dashti„ÄÇ

So this one shows access time and source by„ÄÇAnd also„ÄÇCan show the newest first„ÄÇÎÇò Í∑∏ÎÉ•„ÄÇ

Now let's move on if I would like to show the fridge„ÄÇÂì¶„ÄÇDallasÔºå command„ÄÇ

I'm going to type the long limitation dash dash first„ÄÇFor more information„ÄÇ

 if I would like to get more information about this commandÔºå I go to the main pageÔºå man„ÄÇ

Then spaceless„ÄÇSo can see here get more information about this command„ÄÇ

 and I can see all those options that I can use with the command„ÄÇ

And go back so let's conclude our session„ÄÇ Thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone„ÄÇ

 in this demo I'm going to show you how to use date commandÔºå calendar command and up time command„ÄÇ

The debt command display the current date„ÄÇI'm going to type the command date and hit entered as we can see„ÄÇ

 this is the Q date„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to display the version„ÄÇOf this command„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type the command„ÄÇThen the optionÔºå long notationÔºå So dash dash version„ÄÇ

 then I hit to enter„ÄÇAs you can see here„ÄÇIt shows information about„ÄÇThe comment„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to display the calendar of the current monthÔºå I'm going to type CL then I hit enter„ÄÇ

So you can see here this calendar for this current month„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to display the calendar of as a specific monthÔºå I'm going to type on the CAL then„ÄÇ

The‰πà„ÄÇFor exampleÔºå June 2020Ôºå then hit enter„ÄÇSeemed that if I would like to show„ÄÇËØ∂ÎÇöÂè≤„ÄÇJanuary 2020„ÄÇ

 and it entered the same thing if I want to show the December 22Ôºå2022„ÄÇ

Is going to show the same thing here„ÄÇNowÔºå if i would like to show the„ÄÇThe current time„ÄÇ

 and I would like also to show how many users are currently logged into the system and display also the load average„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use the command up time„ÄÇSo this is the uptime command„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

Shows the current time„ÄÇAnd then it shows up to what it's running up to the system is up or running for one hour right now„ÄÇ

 and it shows how many users we have only one user right now is currently logged into the system„ÄÇ

 Then it shows here the load average„ÄÇNow if I would like to show the up time in a pretty format„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type„ÄÇU„ÄÇUp time then dash P„ÄÇYou can see hereÔºå it shows„ÄÇ

The up time in a pretty format manner and same thingÔºå if I would like to show the„ÄÇ

If I would like to show it in a long notation is going to show me the same output„ÄÇ

 but this time will be dash dash pretty„ÄÇIf I would like to show system up„ÄÇTimeÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 like up timeÔºå then dash is„ÄÇSo this running things up„ÄÇThis time„ÄÇSame thing if I were up time„ÄÇ

 dash dash since„ÄÇIt's going to show us the sent up„ÄÇIf I would like to show the version„ÄÇ

So we'll say up time then„ÄÇDash„ÄÇAn uppercaseÔºå V„ÄÇcan see here is to display the version information„ÄÇ

 I can do the same thing if I want to run„ÄÇA long musician„ÄÇ

If I would like to find more information about the uptime commandÔºå I'm going to go to the mapb„ÄÇ

Can I see here„ÄÇFormation about this command and also the options and go back also the same thing„ÄÇ

 If I would like to get more information about the calendarÔºå man calendar or CL„ÄÇSame thing„ÄÇ

 information about deadÔºå same thingÔºå man„ÄÇ and I go to the date„ÄÇH„ÄÇGo backÔºå let's conclude our session„ÄÇ

 thank you and see you on the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone In this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use LSCPU command and free command„ÄÇ

LS CPU command disciplines information about the processor and a CPU information or architecture„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå I'm going to type LSCBU then I hit enter„ÄÇ

 you can see here you got information about the processor and the CPU„ÄÇ

And if I would like to get more information about this commandÔºå I go to the map page main LS CPU„ÄÇ

Can you get more information about this comment„ÄÇI go back„ÄÇClear the screen„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to„ÄÇ

Dispplay information about the memory I use the command freeÔºå then hit enter„ÄÇYou can see here„ÄÇ

This comment shows discipline information about the memory„ÄÇIf I would like to„ÄÇ

Disipplay the output in a human readable„ÄÇ So I'm going to use the option dash H„ÄÇ

This is a short notation„ÄÇ I can use the„ÄÇLong notÔºå dash dash human„ÄÇAnd chose as the same up„ÄÇ

That's in a humor readable„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to show the version of this command dash„ÄÇ

U case V and I hit enter reference when it shows us information about„ÄÇDelation„ÄÇOf the free comment„ÄÇ

 nowÔºå if I would like to show details about low and high memory statisticsÔºå I'm going to try free„ÄÇ

Then dash l„ÄÇIts entered„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would likeÔºå as you can see hereÔºå is not an human readable„ÄÇ

 So what I'm going to doÔºå I'm going to use that dash edge„ÄÇNowÔºå as you can see hereÔºå we have the„ÄÇ

In a human read„ÄÇAÔºå so went to clear„ÄÇScream„ÄÇNow if I would like to show a total like a land showing column of total of the the„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type dashÔºå so three firstÔºå then dash T„ÄÇH entered„ÄÇ you can see here this is the total„ÄÇ

Callling„ÄÇIf I want to show it in a humor readableÔºå I'm going to put them and this together the T and the H„ÄÇ

 So I'm not going do the same thing like„ÄÇLike every option will be separate„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to tap them together when hit's entered„ÄÇCan see here„ÄÇ you have the total„ÄÇ

Im going to call and torture right now here and also I get the result in a human readable„ÄÇ

That's it for decisionÔºå thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use DF command and D command„ÄÇDF command„ÄÇ

Disipplay the disk usage and partitions on the system„ÄÇ For example„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type Df then I hit enter„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 it shows the disk usage and partitions on the system„ÄÇ

If I would like to show the output in a humor readable way„ÄÇ So I'm going to type the option dash H„ÄÇ

 this is a short notation at enter„ÄÇHow about if I would like to show„ÄÇ

The out in same thing human read but„ÄÇLong rotation I'm going to type dash dash a human dash readable then I hit enter„ÄÇ

As we can see hereÔºå it shows us„ÄÇDisip output in a human rhythm„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to print the file system typeÔºå so I'm going to type Df„ÄÇDashÔºå aque tea„ÄÇSo here„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå it's added a new calling and it shows five system type„ÄÇ

Cl now if I would like the same thing„ÄÇI'm going to use the same command Df„ÄÇBut not a short notation„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use the„ÄÇNo notÔºå so it would be dash dash printÔºå dash type„ÄÇSame thing„ÄÇ

If I would like to show or display the Albert in a humor readable„ÄÇ And also at the same time„ÄÇ

 I would like to print the file system typeÔºå I'm going to„ÄÇRun the command D F with the option„ÄÇ

A bartiÔºå then H the HÔºå I can rack it together with the TÔºå or I can do it this wayÔºå separate„ÄÇ

And hit enter„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇWe print the system type„ÄÇ

 and also at the same time we display data within a human readable„ÄÇWait„ÄÇ

 now let's move on to the next commandÔºå the deal„ÄÇSoÔºå do you„ÄÇDisciples an estimated five space usage„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to„ÄÇHit enter„ÄÇAs you can see hereÔºå we got a long output„ÄÇLet's screen the screen„ÄÇ

 I'm going to insert some„ÄÇI'm going to type some options„ÄÇ So I'm going this time„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use the humor readableÔºå the dash edge„ÄÇ

 So the reason I would like to display output in a humor readable way and I hit enter„ÄÇ

As we can see hereÔºå we can read the rum right now and in a hum readable way„ÄÇ

Clear the screen and going up„ÄÇNow againÔºå I'm going to use if I would like to like show a total„ÄÇ

I'm going to type„ÄÇThe grand totalsÔºå I'm going to use that the option dash C and hit entered„ÄÇ

As we can see here at the bottomÔºå it shows us the total„ÄÇ

How about if I would like to show it also with the humor readable way„ÄÇIn enter„ÄÇ

 you can see the difference right„ÄÇAs it clear the screen in order to get more information about this command„ÄÇ

 I I can go to the man B„ÄÇ so man D you and get more information about it„ÄÇBut this command here„ÄÇ

And also the options that I can use with this command„ÄÇ

 the same thing for you would like also to get more information about the Df command man Df„ÄÇ

You see here is a main page and also the options that I can„ÄÇUse them with Df„ÄÇI go back„ÄÇ

That conclude our sessionÔºå thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone in this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use history commandÔºå clear commandÔºå and exit command„ÄÇ

To show the history and determinationÔºå we time the command history„ÄÇSo as we can see here„ÄÇ

 the history command keeps a list of all the commands that have been used from the session„ÄÇü§¢„ÄÇ



![](img/90a6b57aa3833574d7ddf15cf08afcd8_5.png)

And also it allows us to replay or to use these commands in any instance of retiibring them„ÄÇ



![](img/90a6b57aa3833574d7ddf15cf08afcd8_7.png)

If I would like to tell the shell to return the command on the line of the historyÔºå for example„ÄÇ

This slideÔºå I'm going to type extension markÔºå then the number„ÄÇThis slide87Ôºå and I hit enter„ÄÇ

You can see here„ÄÇThis is the output of the line 87„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to delete a particular command„ÄÇI'm going to type historyory then dash D„ÄÇ

Then I'm going to pick a number here„ÄÇ For exampleÔºå I'm going to pick 96„ÄÇLet's clear the screen„ÄÇ

I'm going to Î≤†Ïä§Ìä∏ right now„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we don't have that command anymore„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to delete the entire„ÄÇU the entire contents of the history file„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type history in dash C„ÄÇClearÔºå then I'm going to type history again„ÄÇ

 So I just have the last two types I just„ÄÇÂ∞± think my be„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to clear the screen„ÄÇ

Over the chair sessionÔºå I'm going to type clear„ÄÇIf I would like to exit the terminalÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 lessÔºå I'm going to log in as a root user„ÄÇNow I only just looked in as a root user„ÄÇ

 Now if I go back to exitÔºå I'm going to type exit„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 if you would like to get more information about the history commandÔºå we can go to the main page„ÄÇ

 man history„ÄÇSame thing if you like to get more information about the clear„ÄÇGo to the mainbe„ÄÇ

 clear the chair screen„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to get also more information about the exit„ÄÇ

 we can go to there„ÄÇMain page of the exit command„ÄÇ Also„ÄÇ

 there is another thing if I would like to exit„ÄÇTheter„ÄÇSo right now I'm root user„ÄÇ

 so I hit or I type exit then I hit enter„ÄÇ

![](img/90a6b57aa3833574d7ddf15cf08afcd8_9.png)

As we can see hereÔºå we close the chairman„ÄÇThat's it for decision„ÄÇ



![](img/90a6b57aa3833574d7ddf15cf08afcd8_11.png)

Thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyoneÔºå And this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use what is commandÔºå T commandÔºå and man command„ÄÇ

What is command discipline one line manual pageÔºüI'm going to type„ÄÇWhat is then Ls„ÄÇSo we can see here„ÄÇ

 display one line manual based description„ÄÇ I'm going to type„ÄÇAlso„ÄÇ

 what is manbe or the man command can see hereÔºå give us information and display one line manual1b descriptions„ÄÇ

And if I'm going to typeÔºå what is LSCBU„ÄÇSame thing„ÄÇ

Now let's move on to the next command type command„ÄÇ

 The type command shows the type of every Linux command„ÄÇ I'm going to write type and what is„ÄÇ

You can see here it shows the type of E„ÄÇLinux scumaÔºå I'm going to write type MÔºå same thing here„ÄÇ

 type info„ÄÇSame thing here shows the type of every Linux command now„ÄÇ

The last command is the manb command„ÄÇ so the manbe„ÄÇ

 we can use this command in order to show us more information and details about the command„ÄÇ

 It's an interface to the online reference many one„ÄÇ For example„ÄÇ

 let's type al right man L you can see here information about this command and also the option and go back to the man B man„ÄÇ

The the main page„ÄÇ This is the main page„ÄÇ Then I'm going to type right nowÔºå manÔºå D F„ÄÇ

And see information about the Df command„ÄÇAnd also the option go back here„ÄÇ

 so we'll write type also manÔºå manÔºå you can see here the man man is an interface to the online reference manual was„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå that's it for decisionÔºå thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇ

Hello everyone In this demo I'm going to show you how to use the W command and the last command„ÄÇ

In order to show who is logged into the system and what they're doingÔºå we type the command value„ÄÇ

If I would like to use the short format and I don't want to print the login time and the GCPU or the PCcPU times„ÄÇ

 then I'm going to type W„ÄÇshorthor mutation is„ÄÇOr I can„ÄÇType the long notationÔºå dash that short„ÄÇ

 and it gives us the same output„ÄÇIf I would like to display version information about W„ÄÇCommand„ÄÇ

 and I went to type W dash our case fee„ÄÇIf I would like to show the old style output„ÄÇ

 then I'm going to type W dash O„ÄÇIf I would like to show information about a specific user„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå student„ÄÇAnd I hit enterÔºå so we get information about„ÄÇUser student„ÄÇ

If I would like to show„ÄÇThe outputÔºå and I want to print the outputs with no heater„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type WÔºå then dash H„ÄÇOr I can say this is a short notation and also maybe I can use the log notation„ÄÇ

 so dash dashÔºå noÔºå then dash„ÄÇHey there„ÄÇAnd it gives us the same out„ÄÇÁÑ∂ÈÇ£‰ªÄ‰πàÈ•≠Â∞±Âæó„ÄÇNext command„ÄÇ

 the last commandÔºå last command shows the listing of the last„ÄÇLogged in users„ÄÇSo for example„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type lastÔºå as you can see hereÔºå we have the list of the users here„ÄÇAnd if I would like„ÄÇ

 I'm going to clear the screen„ÄÇTo display the system shut down En a run level change I'm going to run„ÄÇ

The last commandÔºå then dash„ÄÇX„ÄÇAnd see here we got an information„ÄÇ

The system shut down enter and run let changes„ÄÇthis is the auto information„ÄÇ

 If we use the the option dash X„ÄÇLet's move on to the next one if I would like to display the house name„ÄÇ

In the last column„ÄÇFor exampleÔºå I'm going to type„ÄÇLast then the option dash aÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we can get to display the system„ÄÇOr the host names in the last columns here can see it here„ÄÇ

Now if I would like to discipline„ÄÇFull user names and domains names in the output„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use last10 dash W„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

Its display full users names and domains names on the system„ÄÇ

If you would like to get more information about these two commandsÔºå we can go to the main page man W„ÄÇ

You can see hereÔºå this is the man of„ÄÇOf the W command„ÄÇ

 you can see here also the options that we can use with this command can go back„ÄÇ

 It can go also to the main page of the last„ÄÇComt„ÄÇThat's it for decision„ÄÇ

Thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone In this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use the Uname command and the host name command„ÄÇ

If I would like to bring system informationÔºå I'm going to use the Unname command„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to print all information about the system„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to use the UNM command and dash all So an option as a short notation„ÄÇ

 I can use also the log notation dash dash all„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to bring the kernel name„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type view name„ÄÇDan dashes„ÄÇIf I would like to bring the kernel release„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type Unname in dash R„ÄÇIf I would like to bring the kernel version„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type U name then dash lowercase V„ÄÇIf I would like to print the possess type„ÄÇ

 you named in the option„ÄÇDash PÔºå I can also use the long notation dash dash processor„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to bring the machine hardware nameÔºå so I'm going to type U nameÔºå then dash M„ÄÇ

Or I can use the long notation dash dash machine„ÄÇIf I would like to get more information about this command„ÄÇ

 I can go to the main pageÔºå so manÔºå then you name„ÄÇAnd we can see here„ÄÇ

 we can get more information about this command and the options that we can use with this command„ÄÇ

 Let's go back„ÄÇNow I'm going to move on to the next command„ÄÇ Next command is the host name„ÄÇ

If I would like to show or set the host or the system host name„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to use the command host name„ÄÇIf I would like to display and show a short„ÄÇ

The short host nameÔºå so I'm going to type host nameÔºå then option dash SÔºå the short notation„ÄÇ

 I can use also the long notation dash dash short„ÄÇIf I would like to print the version information on a standard output and exit successfully„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type post nameÔºå then dash uppercase V„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to display the network addresses„ÄÇOf the host name„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to type host name then„ÄÇDash lowercase I„ÄÇ

If I would like to display all network addresses of the hostÔºå so I'm going to type host names„ÄÇ

Then upper case by„ÄÇIf I would like to get more information about this command„ÄÇ

 I can go to the main page of this command and we can see here we can get more details and also the options that we can use with this command„ÄÇ

LastÔºå and finallyÔºå if I want to change the host name„ÄÇ

 so the host name here I have a red hat if I would like to change it toÔºå for exampleÔºå server„ÄÇ

I'm going to open a new tab„ÄÇAnd we can see you here„ÄÇWe have a new host name„ÄÇ

 so we have server that's it for decisionÔºå Thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇ

Hello everyone In this demoÔºå I'm going to show you how to create new files and new directories„ÄÇ

If I would like to create an empty fileÔºå I'm going to use the command touch„ÄÇ

Then the name of the text fileÔºå for exampleÔºå F2 do Txt„ÄÇH enterÔºå then I'm going to type S dash„ÄÇ

 Can see over here we have a new text file„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to create multiple files„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to type touch thenÔºå for example if„ÄÇ3Ôºå the t x TÔºå then a4Ôºå the T x t„ÄÇAnd L S dash up„ÄÇ

 we can see here„ÄÇ we have the F3 and the F4„ÄÇIf I would like to change the file modification time„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå for this file„ÄÇI'm going to change the time here„ÄÇ So what I'm going to do„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type touchÔºå then the short notation M commodification„ÄÇ then the name of the file„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type L S dash L for„ÄÇDespiteÔºå as we can see hereÔºå we have change that„ÄÇ

Time for this fight„ÄÇNow let's move on if I would like to avoid creating new filesÔºå for example„ÄÇ

If I would like to create the new filesÔºå but at the same time„ÄÇ

 the system will not going to create this new file„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type the option dash C in the name of the fileÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 5 so F5 x0 and we hit enter„ÄÇAnd add S dash upÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we don't have this file because of the short notation„ÄÇThe option dash see„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 let's move on to the next commandÔºå the MK D Ir„ÄÇ So this is making directory„ÄÇ

 So we use this command if we would like to create a directory for thet command„ÄÇ

If we would like to create an empty6 file„ÄÇSo if I would like to catch a new directorÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 D IR1„ÄÇAnd L S dashÔºå as we can see hereÔºå we have a new directory„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to create multiple„ÄÇDirecties at the same time„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type the same commandÔºå make directory then D IR 2Ôºå then D IR 3Ôºå D IR 4„ÄÇ

 so we have to make sure there is spaces between the names of those directories and I hit enter L S dash L as we can see here we have„ÄÇ

New data chase here„ÄÇD 2Ôºå3 and 4„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to make parentjectiesÔºå for example„ÄÇM KÔºå D IR„ÄÇ

 then LinuxÔºå then I'm going to create also directory inside this this directoryÔºå then slash red hat„ÄÇ

 then slash send to„ÄÇSent to OSÔºå perfect„ÄÇ and I'm going to hit enter„ÄÇ

But the system will not allow me to create this directoryÔºå so I have to add an option„ÄÇDash b„ÄÇ

To make parent directoriesÔºå then I hit enterÔºå then Ls dash L„ÄÇ So I'm going hereÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we have this new directoryÔºå so I'm going to go inside this directory„ÄÇLS„ÄÇ

 can see here we have this new directive„ÄÇ I'm going to go inside red hat Ls„ÄÇ

We can see here we have this„ÄÇYou can also B theD in order to print„ÄÇThe current working director„ÄÇ

 as you can see hereÔºå we have the Linux„ÄÇThen if I'm going to go inside this into a S here„ÄÇ

 for example„ÄÇAnd PW D about Î∏åÎûúÎìú as we can see here„ÄÇWe have Linux near red hat then send to us„ÄÇ

Now let's move on to the next command„ÄÇSometimes when executing making directory commands„ÄÇ

 there is no feedback for successful operationsÔºå so to see the details of the making directory process„ÄÇ

If I want the system to show me a message that this directory have been created or whatever„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to use the„ÄÇThe command M KDRRÔºå then the option dash V„ÄÇ

Then the name of the directory I'm going to call this5„ÄÇAs you can see hereÔºå I send you a message„ÄÇ

It showshows us that the command created it directory D IR 5„ÄÇ

If I would like to give more information about this commandÔºå I can go to the main page„ÄÇ

And we can see here the MK directory this command makes directories or career directories„ÄÇ

 and we can see here elseÔºå this is all the options that we can use with this command„ÄÇ

That's it for decision„ÄÇ Thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇ

Hello everyone in this demo I'm going to show you how to use CP command and MV command„ÄÇ

CP command copiess files and directoriesÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 if I would like to copy the6 file F1 the TT2 directory1Ôºå so I'm going to type C„ÄÇ

 then the name of the T file F1 the T0Ôºå then the name of the directory„ÄÇ

Now I'm going to check if I do have that expire inside this director„ÄÇI do have F1 that x0„ÄÇ

If I would like to copy a directory to another directory„ÄÇSo CÔºå then I have to add the option dash or„ÄÇ

So this is for the recursive in case if we have subdirecties inside directory2„ÄÇ2Ôºå Direct1„ÄÇ

Let's check it out now„ÄÇYou can see hereÔºå as we can see here on the screen„ÄÇ

 I have the2 inside directory what„ÄÇIn case if I would like to copy the content of Ana file„ÄÇ

 for example here„ÄÇÊàë‰πü‰∏ãÂïä„ÄÇContent T 12Ôºå3 inside the T5Ôºå F1Ôºå dot Tt„ÄÇLet's check X52Ôºå the F2 do Tt„ÄÇ

 We don't have any content thereÔºå so I'm going to use the CP„ÄÇF1Ôºå that TxtÔºå then F2„ÄÇ

 So what I'm going to doÔºå I'm going to copy the content„ÄÇOf check F1Ôºå the6 T2 F2„ÄÇ Let's check F2 now„ÄÇ

PerfectÔºå I as to considerr in the screenÔºå we have 1Ôºå2Ôºå3„ÄÇIf I would like to copy„ÄÇMultiple files„ÄÇ

 for example„ÄÇF2 and F3 to direction 3„ÄÇÎÇò Ïï° Ïõê„ÄÇLet's ship the to you want right now„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 we have„ÄÇTex5Ôºå the F2Ôºå the Tt and F3Ôºå the Txt„ÄÇIf I would like to copy be„ÄÇMore than one directory„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå I would like to copy directory 3 and 4 to directory 1„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type C and we don't have to forget dashard or recursive in case if there is any subdirecties inside these directories„ÄÇ

 so then directory 3ÔºåAndjo x34„ÄÇSo we're going to copy these two directories3 and4 two„ÄÇ

 director 3 one„ÄÇLet's shake the G1 right now„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we have directlyy 3 and4„ÄÇ

If I would like to find more information about this commandÔºå CÔºå we can go to the main page„ÄÇ

You can find more detailsÔºå and also the options„ÄÇThat we can use you use them with the„ÄÇ

With the CB command„ÄÇOkayÔºå let's go back„ÄÇNowÔºå let's move on to„ÄÇThe next commandÔºå the MV command„ÄÇ

 if we would like to find more information about this commandÔºå we can go to the main page„ÄÇ

 So this commandÔºå the MV command„ÄÇMoves are renamesÔºå names of files and directories„ÄÇ

And you can see here here the options that we can use with the MficomaÔºå as go back and„ÄÇ

Do some examples„ÄÇ So I would like to„ÄÇMove„ÄÇF1Ôºå the TXT2 directory boxÔºå so I'm going to type Mv„ÄÇ

F1 T T2 box1„ÄÇWe two box„ÄÇ So then I am going to hit enter„ÄÇ

 I'm going to check right now that directory box„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we have„ÄÇ

They found the TXD glass double check here„ÄÇAnd on the main directory or the home directory right now„ÄÇ

 we don't have a1 that takes T anymore in the current directory„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to move multiple filesÔºå for exampleÔºå F2Ôºå3 and 4Ôºå same thing So M V„ÄÇF2Ôºå then F3„ÄÇ

 and F4 to director 3„ÄÇOÔºå okayÔºå let's check right now„ÄÇAndBÔºå as we can see hereÔºå we have„ÄÇTix file2Ôºå3„ÄÇ

 and 4„ÄÇLet's check right nowÔºå the current directory„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 we don't have all these text files if I would like to move„ÄÇA director3Ôºå so I'm going to type Mv„ÄÇ

 then I'm going to move Direct1„ÄÇTwo box„ÄÇ So Im going to type the you want„ÄÇThen boxÔºå LSÔºå dash L„ÄÇ

 then I to go to this directoryÔºå as we can see hereÔºå we have directory one„ÄÇ

And check right now here in the current directoryÔºå we don't have directory one right now here in this current directory„ÄÇ

If I would like to move„ÄÇMore than one director„ÄÇSo what I'm going to do„ÄÇ

 I'm going to do the same thing MV„ÄÇThenÔºå for exampleÔºå directory2„ÄÇThen director3„ÄÇThen the 34„ÄÇ2„ÄÇ

 two box Sir„ÄÇLet's check right now the directory box„ÄÇ as we can see hereÔºå we have directory 2Ôºå3Ôºå4„ÄÇ

Let's check right now the current directoryÔºå so we don't have directory 2 and3 and4„ÄÇ

If I would like to renameÔºå for exampleÔºå the text file hereÔºå so I'm going to use the same command M V„ÄÇ

ËØ∂ ÎÑ§„ÄÇtext„ÄÇText T EÔºå then text the TxtÔºå then I'm going to call this one file the TXt„ÄÇ

Lets check right nowÔºå as you can see hereÔºå so we change the name to file the Txt„ÄÇ

 if I would like to change the name of any directory would be the same thing„ÄÇ for exampleÔºå box„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use Mv„ÄÇBox„ÄÇTo record this one„ÄÇYou like here Í∑∏ tree„ÄÇPerfect on dash show„ÄÇ

As we can see hereÔºå we change the name of the directory from box to directory„ÄÇThat's it for decision„ÄÇ

 Thank you„ÄÇ And see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone In this demo I'm going to show you how to remove directories and files If I would like to remove an empty directory I'm going to run the command or MDDIR in the name of the directory for example„ÄÇ

 directory for hit enter now I'm going to double check if I do have the directory I don't have directory for here anymore„ÄÇ

Assume that I have a direct and subdirects„ÄÇAnd I would like to remove the subdirecty„ÄÇ

So what I'm going to doÔºå I'm going to use the same command R MDIRÔºå and I have here„ÄÇD1 and inside D1„ÄÇ

 there is D2„ÄÇI'm going to remove D2Ôºå then I hit enter„ÄÇThat little chick„ÄÇD1Ôºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we don't have D2„ÄÇAny more„ÄÇIf I would like to delete parents or the directory and even the subdirecty„ÄÇ

ü§¢ÔºåFor exampleÔºå hereÔºå we have Linux and inside Linux„ÄÇ

 we have another directory or a subjecty it's called D hat so I'm going to type ourMDIR„ÄÇ

 then I have to type the option dash P„ÄÇThis appearance„ÄÇ

 so he' is going to delete the directory and the subdirecty„ÄÇ So LinuxÔºå then red hat I hit enter„ÄÇ

L S dash L„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we don't have„ÄÇThe Linux directory anymore„ÄÇ

If I would like to get more information about this commandÔºå I can go to the man page„ÄÇ

and we can get more details and information about r m„ÄÇD IR comment„ÄÇ

There is another command also we can use let's go to the main page of the RM„ÄÇ

So RM removes files and directors„ÄÇSo for the previous commandÔºå the RMDR„ÄÇ

 that one is just to remove directoriesÔºå but for the RM it remove so the RM removes the files and directories„ÄÇ

So okayÔºå let's go back here and what I would like to do right nowÔºå I would like to remove„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå the text file„ÄÇüòîÔºåHere R M and F1Ôºå the Txt„ÄÇThat step of shake„ÄÇ

So we don't have the text file anymore„ÄÇ if one does TxT„ÄÇIf I would like to remove„ÄÇA directory„ÄÇ

 for example„ÄÇSeem that I would like to remove direction 3Ôºå so R M„ÄÇHoweverwi„ÄÇ4„ÄÇThis command„ÄÇ

 we have to use the recursive the dash R in case if there is any subdirecties inside the direct„ÄÇ

 So and then I'm going to type D IR 3 hit enter L S dashL„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 we don't have D3 here anymore„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like„ÄÇTo run the option dash IÔºå for exampleÔºå here„ÄÇ

 the RN dash I in order to promote or to ask us the system will ask the user„ÄÇBefore every remover„ÄÇ

 if you are sure do you want to delete this text fileÔºå for exampleÔºå if I would like to delete F4„ÄÇ

We want the type of forceÔºå so the system will promote a questionÔºå so it is going see it here„ÄÇ

Now I have to answer yesÔºå hit enter a list dash L you can see here„ÄÇ so we don't have„ÄÇF4 anymore„ÄÇ

And there is also another option„ÄÇIts dashÔºå if iss for„ÄÇ

Dash F like force if I would like to force the system to remove the fileÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 Im going to force the system to delete this director„ÄÇ I'm going to hit enter S dash L„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we don't have D1 anymore„ÄÇIf I would like to remove all the text files„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to Rm„ÄÇDash R„ÄÇThen I'm going to type star that Txt„ÄÇ

 So on this command I'm going to tell the system that I would like to remove all the text file„ÄÇ

 so anything doesn't matter we start with what that Txt as long as the file ends with the Txt„ÄÇ

 so the system will remove that text file„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåH enter L dash l„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

We don't have any fixed anymore„ÄÇ if I would like to remove the diies„ÄÇ Also„ÄÇ

 I'm going to do the same thing R M D R„ÄÇSo our aim dash dash R this is for the recursive„ÄÇ

 then I'm going to type D I R then star„ÄÇSo as we can notice here„ÄÇWe have one and 2„ÄÇ soÔºå and they are„ÄÇ

 they have the same name„ÄÇ TheyÔºå they like they share the D IR and the D IR at the beginning„ÄÇ

 So I would like toÔºå I'm going to„ÄÇTeill the system2Ôºå delete all the directors„ÄÇ

 It doesn't matter what's the ending„ÄÇOf this directoryÔºå I'm what to enter right now LSL„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we don't have the directories here anymore„ÄÇI would like to get more information„ÄÇ

 as I mentionedÔºå I can go to the of the RM„ÄÇYou can see here we can find more information about this command and also we can find the options that we can use with this command„ÄÇ

Let's conclude our session„ÄÇThank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use the T command„ÄÇThe tar command is an archive in utility„ÄÇFor example„ÄÇ

 if I would like to create a tar archive file for directory files„ÄÇ

First I'm going to type the tar commandÔºå then I'm going to use the option dash C„ÄÇ

In order to create a new D archive file„ÄÇAnd alsoÔºå I'm going to use the option V ver both show that that tar file progress and the option F„ÄÇ

It's for the fine name type of the archive file„ÄÇThen space„ÄÇ

 and I'm going to call this the tar Arch file F1Ôºå and I have also to type the extension of this file„ÄÇ

 so will be that tar space„ÄÇ then the name of the directory hit enter Ls dashL as we can see here we have a new tar archive file„ÄÇ

NowÔºå if I would like to create a compressed G zip archive fileÔºå I use the option dash Z„ÄÇ

So I'm going to type the tar command„ÄÇ then dash„ÄÇ see„ÄÇ then the dash Z is for the Gi zip„ÄÇAr file„ÄÇ

 then V F„ÄÇSpaceÔºå I'm going to call this one F2 do tar„ÄÇ

 then also I have to to type the extension for the compressed GZ archive file„ÄÇDot„ÄÇZi„ÄÇZit„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

Then the name of the directoryÔºå as we can see over hereÔºå we have the command and the options„ÄÇ

 and we have the Z„ÄÇ then the name of the„ÄÇThe compressed Gzearkafi then the name of the directory„ÄÇ

At enter„ÄÇ there is another way also we can do over here„ÄÇ

 If I would like to combine this two extension togetherÔºå I can write it this way T G Z at enter„ÄÇ

L S dash LÔºå as we can see over hereÔºå I have two compressed G zip archive Phi„ÄÇ

If I would like to create a compressed B Z 2 archive fileÔºå I use the option dash„ÄÇLower case J„ÄÇ So C„ÄÇ

 lowercase J than V F„ÄÇIn spaceÔºå and I'm going to call this one F3 dot tar„ÄÇThen that be zipped too„ÄÇ

Then the name of the directory files„ÄÇAt enteredÔºå there is also another way and a short way„ÄÇ

 I can do it this way„ÄÇ So it will be dot B Z2„ÄÇ I will keep this the race as as it is as for here at the J„ÄÇ

This is for the„ÄÇCompressed B zip„ÄÇTo archive fileÔºå then I hit enter a dash L„ÄÇAs we can see over here„ÄÇ

 we have these two files„ÄÇ This is the first one„ÄÇ this is the compressed bi zip„ÄÇTwo areal„ÄÇ

 and this is the second ones„ÄÇIf I would like to create a compressed Xz archive file„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type tart dash„ÄÇCÔºå this is to createÔºå as we saidÔºå the new Dar archive file„ÄÇ

 and for the compressed exit archive fileÔºå I'm going to use the uppercase J„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåThen the Vf„ÄÇSpace„ÄÇ

 I'm going to call this one a4 doctor„ÄÇThen dot X Z„ÄÇ

 then the name of the directory hit enter L S dash L„ÄÇ as we can see here„ÄÇ

 I have the compressed X Z archive5„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to list the contents of the chart„ÄÇ

Arive file„ÄÇ I'm going to check chart„ÄÇThen dash TÔºå So the T is to list the contents of the tar archiv file„ÄÇ

 then Vf„ÄÇThen the name off„ÄÇDa„ÄÇIf oneÔºå the name of that„ÄÇ5„ÄÇIt enter„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇAfter we„ÄÇ

Added the optionÔºå dashty„ÄÇIn order to list the contents of the tar archive file„ÄÇIf I would like to„ÄÇ

Enter or extract a tar file„ÄÇI'm going to type„ÄÇFirstÔºå let's I'm going to move the„ÄÇ

One of the tars fires here„ÄÇTo the directory boxÔºå for example„ÄÇThen I'm going to C D to the box„ÄÇ

Alas dashel„ÄÇ So we have this„ÄÇThe tar fileÔºå then I'm going to enter or extract this tar file„ÄÇ

Go to cha„ÄÇDash x„ÄÇV F then the name of the„ÄÇTar file hit enterÔºå then LS dashil„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 we have the directory files„ÄÇLet's go back„ÄÇAnd there is also another way if I would like to enter or extract in a different directories„ÄÇ

So I can use the option dash uppercase C„ÄÇ So I'm going to„ÄÇType the commandarÔºå then dash X„ÄÇ

This one is for Antar or or extract„ÄÇThe cha fileÔºå then Vf„ÄÇÁúüÁöÑ nameÊàëË¥üË¥£„ÄÇ

File directly for the chart file„ÄÇFor exampleÔºå we're going to use this one„ÄÇThe G it„ÄÇThe Jesus said„ÄÇ

 then after thatÔºå I'm going to type dash uppercase see„ÄÇI' am going to add this„ÄÇËØ∂„ÄÇ

The after I'm going to extract„ÄÇThe file to this directory to the directory boxÔºå hit enter„ÄÇ

Then I'm going to„ÄÇDiirecty box just to make sure that we have the file over there„ÄÇAs we can see„ÄÇ

We have the new directory hereÔºå but„ÄÇIf I would like to get more information about„ÄÇThis command„ÄÇ

 I can go to the main page„ÄÇOf the cha command„ÄÇAnd we can for find more details and also all the options that we can use with this comment„ÄÇ

That conclude our sessionÔºå thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone In this demomo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use the CA command and the echoco command„ÄÇFirst„ÄÇ

 let's start with the cat command„ÄÇ Cat is the shortcut for the concateate It basically fu the content of the file and prints on the standard output„ÄÇ

ü§¢ÔºåLet's do some example if I would like to show the content of the58C slash bath Wd„ÄÇ

 so as we can see here„ÄÇI type the CA command firstÔºå then slashÔºå it is see then slash„ÄÇ

Best W D page enterÔºå as we can seeÔºå we get the output„ÄÇAnd we show the content of this file„ÄÇ

 You can do another example for another file„ÄÇ it is C slash shadow„ÄÇHdge enterÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we can see the content of this file„ÄÇI also can view the contents of multiple files„ÄÇ for example„ÄÇ

 I have to write first CA commandÔºå then F1„ÄÇThat takes DÔºå then F2Ôºå that takes T I to enter„ÄÇ

 as we can see here„ÄÇThe first Albert„ÄÇFor the first fileÔºå a1 dot takes0 and the second output„ÄÇ

Is for the second5„ÄÇF26Ôºå I can do it also for these two files„ÄÇ it is C slash pass„ÄÇ

WD and ETC slash shadow„ÄÇIt enterÔºå as we can seeÔºå we got„ÄÇThe output for both files„ÄÇCl„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 let's move on„ÄÇIf I would like to see the line numbers of a fileÔºå I can run the optionÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 hereÔºå dash in so you can use this option then„ÄÇThe name of the file or the text file here to enter„ÄÇ

 as we can see over hereÔºå I can do the same thing here in„ÄÇOr for the most„ÄÇAnd I hit to enter„ÄÇ

 as we can see over hereÔºå this is the numbersÔºå the line numbers„ÄÇ

![](img/90a6b57aa3833574d7ddf15cf08afcd8_14.png)

Of the5„ÄÇNow I'm going to move on to the next commandÔºå the Eco command„ÄÇ

Eco command display a line of a text or a string on a standard output or a file„ÄÇ For example„ÄÇ

 if I would like to display a line of a text on a standard output„ÄÇ

 I am going to type first the Eco commandÔºå then I can write a text or a string„ÄÇ

 for example here Holo„ÄÇOr then explanation mark hit enterÔºå as we can see over here„ÄÇ

Its this command display a line of a text or string on the output„ÄÇOrder on a send Albert order file„ÄÇ

 Now we gonna do the file„ÄÇIf I would like to redirect the operators to a file and not to standard your output„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type Eco first„ÄÇDim„ÄÇThe strength that I would like to redirect HoÔºå for exampleÔºå Ho word„ÄÇ

Exition markÔºå then I'm going to use the sine space sign greater than„ÄÇ

Then I'm going to direct just outcome to a text file„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåSo as we can see„ÄÇ

 we have the echoco command first space then the string„ÄÇThen space„ÄÇ

 then assign greater than then spaceÔºå then the name of the5 hit enter„ÄÇ

 Now I'm going to do CA file the text„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we have„ÄÇ

The texts that that we redirect the text to„ÄÇTo the file statistics„ÄÇ

If I would like to remove all the spaces in between the textÔºå I can run the option„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåDash e„ÄÇThen„ÄÇ

 between a quotation mark„ÄÇI am going to type HoÔºå and also I have to add slash B„ÄÇ

So the slash B is to remove all the spaces in between the text then„ÄÇI'm going to tie board„ÄÇDanlei„ÄÇ

Close the quotation and hit enter„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå what we did„ÄÇ

We removed all the spaces in between the text„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to„ÄÇ

To print files of a specific kind echo„ÄÇDian„ÄÇI'm going to do for the text file„ÄÇ So I'm going to„ÄÇ

I'm going to type starface then that Tt„ÄÇ So what I'm going to do in this command„ÄÇ

 I'm going to print all the files of„ÄÇThe Txt typeÔºå then hit enterÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇIt's print„ÄÇ

Or discipline a line of all„ÄÇThe files for the the Tx T extension„ÄÇ

If I would like to get more information about the command cat„ÄÇ

 I can go to the main page and I can find the options for this command and the same thing for the command„ÄÇ

ÂëÉ„Åà„Ç≥„ÄÇYou can find also all the options and details about this comment„ÄÇThat conclude our session„ÄÇ

 Thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone In this video I'll show you how to use the head tail and sword commands„ÄÇ

 So in many cases you might only be interested to display the first few lines of a file and for that case„ÄÇ

 you can use the head command for exampleÔºå if I run the command head s Esy s pathwd it will show me the first few lines of the file s Esy s pathwd„ÄÇ

 In factÔºå the head command displays the first 10 lines by default All right„ÄÇ

The head command can accept more than one file as an argumentÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 the file on the command head s Esy slash passwd s Esy slash group„ÄÇ

It will show you the first 10 lines of both files here okay so you can pass multiple files as an argument to the head command as you can see the first 10 lines of the slash E C slash grew file and the first 10 lines of the s et C s pathwd file you might be wondering what if I want to view„ÄÇ

The first three lines of a file in that caseÔºå you can use the dash an option or pass the dash an option followed by the number of lines followed by your file„ÄÇ

So here„ÄÇI'm showing the first three lines of the file s Esy s passWD„ÄÇ

And here I'm going to show the first seven lines because I like number sevenÔºå it's my lucky number„ÄÇ

So here I show the first seven lines of my file slash etsy s group okay„ÄÇ

 amazing now what about the opposite caseÔºå what about if you want to see or display the last few lines of a fileÔºü

In that caseÔºå you can use the tail commandÔºå make senseÔºå the opposite of head is still„ÄÇ

Tale s Esy s pastwD will show you the last 10 lines by default of a fileÔºå and in a similar fashion„ÄÇ

 you can use multiple files here„ÄÇLet's see the different file„ÄÇSlash Esy slash services is a very„ÄÇ

Nice file here it shows you all the different Linux services and the port number they use and the protocol as well„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so here„ÄÇI see the last 10 lines of the file slash Esy slash services and the last 10 lines of the file slash Esy slash path Wd„ÄÇ

And the till command also accepts the dash in option„ÄÇSo let's see the last three services„ÄÇüòî„ÄÇ

And let's see the last seven lines of the file slash essay slash group„ÄÇüòîÔºåOkayÔºå amazing stuff now„ÄÇ

The only remaining command that I will discuss in this video is the thought command„ÄÇ

 and as you may have expectedÔºå the thought command simply sorts a file„ÄÇTo demonstrate„ÄÇ

 I created two files„ÄÇOne called the fruit dot TXT and one called a number do TXT„ÄÇ

The fruit to TXT contains all the fruits I like„ÄÇüòîÔºåAnd I really want to get a kiwi right now„ÄÇ

And the number to Txt contained the numbers from 1 to 10 in a random orderÔºå as you can see here now„ÄÇ

What if I want to sort the file through do Txt alphabeticallyÔºå I can run the command sort„ÄÇü§¢„ÄÇ

Fruit do TXTÔºå as you can see now my favorite fruits are sorted alphabetically appleÔºå bananaÔºå berry„ÄÇ

 kiwiÔºå mangoÔºå orangeÔºå strawberry Okay what if I do the same thing on the number do TXT„ÄÇWait a minute„ÄÇ

 they are not sorted„ÄÇ It definitely change something hereÔºå but they are not sorted„ÄÇ

 That's because if you want to sort numbersÔºå you have to pass„ÄÇThe dash an option„ÄÇTo the sort command„ÄÇ

Number to TxTÔºå as you can see hereÔºå my file is sorted„ÄÇSo here's again„ÄÇIf I see the file„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I run the dash in„ÄÇAs you can seeÔºå it displays the output in a sorted way„ÄÇüòîÔºåAll right„ÄÇ

 so this takes us to the end of this video„ÄÇ I hope you guys enjoyed itÔºå Co„ÄÇ

Hello everyone in this demoÔºå I'm going to show you how to use the pipe command and the grip command„ÄÇ

FirstÔºå let's start with the pie command„ÄÇ The pipe command helps to use two or more commands as one command in order to retrieve and obtain one output„ÄÇ

Let's show some examples how to use cos with pipe Com„ÄÇI'm going to type first„ÄÇThe command„ÄÇ

 cat slash  E0 seat slash baability space in the pipe„ÄÇThen the second command is this„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå this is the first command„ÄÇThen the pipeÔºå then less hit enter„ÄÇ

And I'm going to do another example hereÔºå the CA slash ETC slash shadow„ÄÇThen space five then more„ÄÇ

It enteredÔºå as we can see hereÔºå we get one up„ÄÇI'm going to do another example hereÔºå slash pin„ÄÇ

 then pipe„ÄÇAnd I'm going to use the command WCÔºå WC printÔºå new line word and Pi counts for each file„ÄÇ

And alsoÔºå I'm going to use the option dashL in order to get the number of lines hit enter„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we got one up„ÄÇLet's do another example here for the file month„ÄÇ

So the first command is cat math thattic exceed and pipe„ÄÇIn this case„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use the commandly CÔºå then dash C in order to get the number of characters I hit enter„ÄÇ

As we can see hereÔºå we get one output„ÄÇI'm going to do this time Cat for this file„ÄÇ F„ÄÇ

 the Tx T and the pipe„ÄÇThenÔºå W C„ÄÇDash W„ÄÇSo the dash W is the option gets the number of folds at a hit enter„ÄÇ

Now let's move on to another example that I'm going to show the content of the F2 that Ht„ÄÇ

 as we can see over hereÔºå now I'm going to use the„ÄÇ

Head command dash in the number means that I would like to show the first is3„ÄÇ

Lines and the file F2 that takes T„ÄÇ And also at the same timeÔºå I would like to use the pipe„ÄÇUntil„ÄÇ

Dash and the number one„ÄÇ So what I'm going to tell the systemÔºå since we have the pipe here„ÄÇ

I'm not going to show the firstest three lines„ÄÇ I'm going to show the last line„ÄÇHereÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 here„ÄÇThe freightest command shows the freight is3 line 1Ôºå20 and 2Ôºå but with detailed dash in1„ÄÇ

I'm going to show only the last line here I hit enteredÔºå as we can see hereÔºå we got the last line„ÄÇ

If I'm going to change the number here to2„ÄÇSo let's take the first command here„ÄÇ

I'm going to show the first three linesÔºå howeverÔºå with the pipe tell dash and then the number two„ÄÇ

 it means that I would like to show the last two lines and hit enterÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we get the last two lines here„ÄÇNow let's move on to the next command„ÄÇ

 the grip command grip command prints lines matching a batterÔºå for exampleÔºå grip„ÄÇThen noÔºå log in„ÄÇ

4 the5 ATC slash bass deputy„ÄÇPerfectÔºå I'm not going to use the pipe here„ÄÇ

 I just want to get the outcome first„ÄÇ Then we're going to use the pipe to compare the outcome between this outcome and the next outcome„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to hit enter as we can see here„ÄÇ we get a long outcomeÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 because we didn't use the pipe with another„ÄÇComtÔºå so I'm going to use the same command here„ÄÇ

Then space5Ôºå WCÔºå then dash L in order to get the number of lines ahead enterÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we get totally different out„ÄÇËØ∂„ÄÇGoing to do another example also hereÔºå Cat number„ÄÇFirst„ÄÇ

 I'm going to run the„ÄÇThe commandÔºå I'm not going to use the pipe command here hit enter„ÄÇ

 as we can seeÔºå we get the numbers from 1 to 20„ÄÇ NowÔºå I'm going to use the pipe command„ÄÇ

Then I'm going to use sort„ÄÇAnd I hit enter„ÄÇAs we can see over here„ÄÇ

We sorted the content of the file based on the numberÔºå it started from oneÔºå then two and so on„ÄÇ

If I wouldnt do„ÄÇcat„ÄÇmonth„ÄÇI'm going to do this example of the month and the pipe„ÄÇ

 Then I would like to grab a„ÄÇAnd I hit enter„ÄÇAs we can see over hereÔºå we got the outcomes that has„ÄÇ

Do what„ÄÇThe letter A„ÄÇIf I will do the same thing but a different letter grip PÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 so with the PÔºå I'm going to get outcome„ÄÇWith litter„ÄÇB„ÄÇIf I will use the head command„ÄÇHead minus n„ÄÇ

 then number 5„ÄÇ It means that I would like to show the first„ÄÇ5 flies and„ÄÇFileman the takesti„ÄÇ

 then the pipe sort„ÄÇHitch enter„ÄÇSoÔºå we get the first„ÄÇ5 lines„ÄÇ

 then what the pipe we ser them based on the alphabets„ÄÇDo the last example here tell„ÄÇMinus n„ÄÇ

Then number threeÔºå I'm going to do it for the month„ÄÇThe textt fileÔºå then the pipeÔºå then sort„ÄÇ

Command dash R or the recursive„ÄÇ then hit enter„ÄÇ as we can see hereÔºå we got„ÄÇAn outcomeÔºå based on„ÄÇ

The reverse way for the source comment„ÄÇThat conclude our session„ÄÇ

 thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use the D command„ÄÇThe di command compares files line by line„ÄÇ

 for example„ÄÇI would like to compare this two fileÔºå the F1Ôºå the Tt„ÄÇThen the F2 that Txt„ÄÇ

So what I didÔºå I wrote„ÄÇThe de command firstÔºå then space„ÄÇThen the name of the first text file here„ÄÇ

 I have f1 dot Tt and space then the name of the second text file„ÄÇ So F2 dot Tt hit enter„ÄÇ

And I also can do the same command with option Y„ÄÇIn order to display the Albert in two columns side by side„ÄÇ

And I hit enterÔºå OkayÔºå let's analyze the output here as we can see here so„ÄÇThe first line here„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå comparing to this one„ÄÇIt means this„ÄÇIt tells us to delete0 from the file„ÄÇ

And the second lineÔºå as we can see hereÔºå is the sameÔºå so we don't need to do anything„ÄÇ

 so here to the delete So D„ÄÇIt means to delete this„ÄÇAnd as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we have to delete the value zero„ÄÇAnd here in the second lineÔºå as we can see2„ÄÇAdd2„ÄÇ

 So it means over hereÔºå we need to add 20 to the first line„ÄÇThe third line„ÄÇ

 we just need to do anything„ÄÇFourth one hereÔºå as we can see over here„ÄÇ

 we need to delete this one and to add3„ÄÇAnd we can see here the line7in and eighth„ÄÇ

 we need to change them with line sevenin hereÔºå so as we can see here the sevenin„ÄÇ

 we need to change it with what with 10„ÄÇAnd the last line8Ôºå we need to delete it„ÄÇ

 as we can see over here„ÄÇ So 7 and8Ôºå it change it with 7„ÄÇ

 so it means that we need to delete 7 and we need to add 10„ÄÇSo let's repeat this againÔºå D represent„ÄÇ

 delete and a add C to change„ÄÇI prefer this one„ÄÇ So this one the dash U in order to display the output in two columns side by side so we can see the difference„ÄÇ

 This is the first text file F1 the T TÔºå and this is the second„ÄÇAs we can see over here„ÄÇ

 this is the second X F2 that isD„ÄÇIf I would like to report only when file differsÔºå so if there is„ÄÇ

II changed the dash to dash Q I use this one before I run these two commands in order to report only when files differ and hit enter„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå this is the message from the system to tell us this there is difference between these two files„ÄÇ

And I'm going to do another example De minus C„ÄÇ So the minus c as we can see here„ÄÇ

 if I would like to produce the output and the contents format„ÄÇ So I run this option„ÄÇ

 then the name of the first fileÔºå then here is the name of the text file hit enter„ÄÇSo it means here„ÄÇ

This is the first fileÔºå and this is the second file„ÄÇAs we can see over here also„ÄÇ

 this is the numbers of the lines and also here is the numbers of the lines„ÄÇus„ÄÇ

 it means that to delete„ÄÇIf there is nothing beside the lineÔºå it means there is nothing to do„ÄÇ

 is the same so one„ÄÇIs the same here like one„ÄÇ So with onlyÔºå we need to delete0„ÄÇ

And the explanation markÔºå as we can see hereÔºå we need to change those lines„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåAnd the same thing„ÄÇ

 we need to change this with this one„ÄÇ so we need to„ÄÇAnd the same thing here„ÄÇ

 we need to change that one„ÄÇIf we would like to get more information about this command about the the command„ÄÇ

 you're going to go to the mapage and we can find more information and details and also the options that we can use with this command„ÄÇ

Let's conclude our sessionÔºå thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone and this demomo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to explain the difference between Sucom and SU Com„ÄÇ

I use the Su command when I would like to run a single command with wood privileges„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 I need to be in the suitable file„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåOr to be in a group in the suitable fight„ÄÇ

So let's do an example hereÔºå for exampleÔºå if I would like to display the content of the shadow file„ÄÇ

The system will not allow me to show that fileÔºå because I don't have a permission to view the content of this file„ÄÇ

So it's permission tonightÔºå so since student is part or it is in a group„ÄÇ

 it is in a root group and the Su file so I can use the Suu command in order to view that file„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to type Sudo first„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåThen the command catÔºå slash ETC slash shadowÔºå I hit into„ÄÇ

Then I have two type the password word„ÄÇA change and I can display the content of the shadow file„ÄÇ

Same thank you for the F this command„ÄÇSDA H enter„ÄÇI don't have any permission the permission denied„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to use the Su command in order to use„ÄÇÂØπÂïä„ÄÇIf discÔºå command„ÄÇI hit enter„ÄÇ

 as we can see here right now„ÄÇI can run„ÄÇThe if this command„ÄÇWhen I use the su do„ÄÇCom on„ÄÇ

 why because student is in a group„ÄÇIn the S fileÔºå so the student has privilegees to run single command in the system with root privilegees„ÄÇ

ü§¢ÔºåNow let's move on to the next commandÔºå the command issue is the issue„ÄÇ

Is used to switch to another user So the S„ÄÇI is the short for switch and U is the short for user„ÄÇ

But you can also switch to the root user by invoking the command with no parameters„ÄÇ

 So let's do firstÔºå the first example here S dash then„ÄÇThen at the name of the user„ÄÇ

 saw an example hereÔºå If I would like to use the option dash or dash LÔºå or dashÔºå dash log„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇ

In order to whatÔºå in order to start the shell as a log and shell with the environment similar to„ÄÇü§¢„ÄÇ

A real logging„ÄÇ what it meansÔºå I'm going to open a new shell for user tone„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to hit enter„ÄÇIm going to type the password right nowÔºå I have a new shelf for user top„ÄÇ

I'm going to exit now„ÄÇIf if I'm going to do just the S without dashÔºå then the name of the user Tom„ÄÇ

 I hit enter„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåGoing to type the password„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 we didn't orbit like a new shared with the environment similar„ÄÇ So I'm still„ÄÇ

In the shell of the city„ÄÇ So if I'm going to type Ls„ÄÇ

I have a permission denied because I don't have the privileges„ÄÇ

In order or the permission order to list or view the content of user term„ÄÇ

 so we have to pay attention to this pointÔºå So is the best way to use SUÔºå then dash„ÄÇ

 then the name of the user„ÄÇAnd there is also another thing if right now I'm a user student„ÄÇ

 if I would like to switch to a root userÔºå I can type Su do„ÄÇThen issueÔºå dashÔºå hit enter„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 I'm a root user„ÄÇSo I don't need like since I switch the user„ÄÇFrom a student to root„ÄÇ

 I don't have to use the pseudo commandÔºå I can run any commandÔºå for exampleÔºå here ATC„ÄÇAnd schedule„ÄÇ

As you can see„ÄÇNowÔºå let's run also the F disk without F disk„ÄÇSlash slash dev slash SD„ÄÇ

 you can see hereÔºå we can run the command without„ÄÇÊï∞ do come„ÄÇÏïÑÎ©ç Í∑∏ Ïôú„ÄÇExit as also„ÄÇ

 I can log into the root user by typing S„ÄÇThen dash like that„ÄÇ hit enter„ÄÇThatwardÔºå right now„ÄÇ

 I what it„ÄÇ I switched from„ÄÇA student user to a route user For more information about the command„ÄÇ

 Su doÔºå we can go to the main page and we can find more details and the options also that we can use with„ÄÇ

Su commandÔºå the same thing for the SU man SUÔºå and we can run a command with substitute user and a group ID so we can find also the options over here„ÄÇ

That conclude our sessionÔºå thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHello everyone in this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use the find command„ÄÇFind command searches for list„ÄÇ

 files and directories„ÄÇI also can use conditions with fine command„ÄÇFor exampleÔºå I can use names„ÄÇ

 file typeÔºå sizeÔºå usersÔºå groupsÔºå permissions and so on let's apply some examples to show how to use the find command first I'm going to type find then I would like to type from where to start the search so in this case I would like to type dot„ÄÇ

Which means I would like to start the search from this„ÄÇCurrent working director„ÄÇ

 So the current working director is the slash routeÔºå then„ÄÇType„ÄÇThat's the type like the type„ÄÇ

 either files or directors that I would like to to do with a search„ÄÇ

 So in this example I would like to do a search for files then I hit enter„ÄÇAs we can see here„ÄÇ

 we get all the files under this current working directory„ÄÇIf I would like to do another example„ÄÇ

 same thingÔºå I will do this time under slash homeÔºå So I would like to start the search from„ÄÇ

Slash homeÔºå then the type„ÄÇDiirory hit enter„ÄÇ So as we can see„ÄÇ

 we got all the directories under the slash how„ÄÇIf I would like to find all the text files using„ÄÇ

The option„ÄÇDash name„ÄÇ So let's do that I'm going to do the search from the current working in director„ÄÇ

 then the name„ÄÇThen the name I would like to mention what exactly Im going to search„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to search for the that takesÔºå So I'm goingÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇüòî„ÄÇ

I'm going to look for all the namesÔºå it doesn't matter our caseÔºå our case„ÄÇ

 because we wrote here the star„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåThen that Tx T„ÄÇ So this is the extension that I would like to look for all the files that has the extension TxT„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå I have to type„ÄÇThe star that takess the under quotation markÔºå then I hit enter„ÄÇ

As we can see hereÔºå we got all the„ÄÇFÔºå it doesn't matter„ÄÇ we didn't„ÄÇIn this case„ÄÇ

 we didn't mention the type because we already says that we would like to get all the files or the text files under the current working director„ÄÇ

If I would like to do the ignore caseÔºå let's see if we do haveÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 we don't I'm going to first I'm going to create„ÄÇTwo directionsÔºå so as we can see here„ÄÇ

That's lowercase down here„ÄÇI'm going to do this upper case and a hit enter„ÄÇAnd less that know„ÄÇ

You can see here we have two directories„ÄÇNow if i would like to do the search„ÄÇ

And this current work in generic tree„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇDash name„ÄÇThen D D IR„ÄÇAnd we will enters„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we got one output„ÄÇ HoweverÔºå if I would do the dash I in name„ÄÇ

So I name means that it's ignoring case or is going to ignore either upper case or lower case„ÄÇ Hey„ÄÇ

 tinÔºå as we can see hereÔºå we got what„ÄÇTwo outcomes„ÄÇ so because we added the I here„ÄÇ

 so it is the ignoring case„ÄÇSo it doesn't matter if it's upper case or lower case„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to„ÄÇUse the dash delete to delete this directory„ÄÇ So first„ÄÇ

 I'm going to find that the current working directory I name„ÄÇBefore going to do that L S dashL„ÄÇ

 So what I'm going to do hereÔºå I'm going to delete these two directories„ÄÇ So findÔºå then dotÔºå then I„ÄÇ

 nameÔºå then D I RÔºå then„ÄÇI'm going to add another option hereÔºå dash delete and hit enter LS F„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we don't have these two directories anymore„ÄÇIf I would like to„ÄÇ

Use the option here under whom I'm going to do„ÄÇOptionÔºå dash size„ÄÇ So I'm gonna look„ÄÇ

4 does it matter file or directories under the slash homeÔºüThe working director here„ÄÇThe slash home„ÄÇ

Thenin„ÄÇI'm going to saysÔºå for exampleÔºå 20 mega„ÄÇ so I'm going to look for all five directories that has the size 20 mega I hit enter„ÄÇ

 We didn't get any outcomeÔºå however I can change„ÄÇThe search from where I can start„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to start from the top from the top level from the root directory or the root file system I hit enter„ÄÇ

And I wait for a bit„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we got all all the files and directories that has size 20„ÄÇ

Now let's move on if I would like to use another option„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to do here the current working directory firstÔºå then the typeÔºå I'm going to do file„ÄÇ

Then dash so in this case in this example I'm going to use the permission„ÄÇ

 so this is the short for permission dash permÔºå so then I'm going to type the permission 066 we will talk more about the permissions and the file ownership and permission levels in the next level and the next chapter„ÄÇ

When we're going to explain more about how we can use these permissionsÔºå hit enter„ÄÇ

We didn't get an outcome„ÄÇ HoweverÔºå I can start from the top level at enterÔºå as we can see over here„ÄÇ

We got all the files and directories that has the permissionÔºå0Ôºå6Ôºå6Ôºå6„ÄÇ

And now we're going do the example about how we can use the users„ÄÇ So clear find„ÄÇ

I'm going to start here in this current working directory„ÄÇThen type„ÄÇ

I'm going to do directory this timeÔºå then dash user„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to look for all the directories that belongs to this user to the user student„ÄÇ

And I hit enter„ÄÇDidn't get anything„ÄÇ HoweverÔºå if I will change„ÄÇTo start from the top level„ÄÇ

 hit enter„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we got all the„ÄÇDireoryÔºå directory is hereÔºå and they' just user„ÄÇ

Or that or the or the directors that belongs to this user„ÄÇI can do the same thing if I would like to„ÄÇ

 for example„ÄÇDo group„ÄÇThen we have a group student„ÄÇHeyÔºå ginger„ÄÇSo you can see who we get„ÄÇ

All the directions that belongs to group students„ÄÇNowÔºå let's move on to another example here„ÄÇ

So another example if I would like to do„ÄÇSish„ÄÇIf I would like to search ticks within multiple files„ÄÇ

So the multiple files hereÔºå for example„ÄÇI'm going to do„ÄÇCt month firstÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 we have this6 file„ÄÇAnd I would like to searchÔºå for exampleÔºå for„ÄÇThe month March„ÄÇ

 I'm going to search for a keyword here„ÄÇ So I'm going to do fine first then dot„ÄÇ

The current working director then the typeÔºå so the type would be F so the5 text5Ôºå then the name here„ÄÇ

So in this hereÔºå the name I have to say„ÄÇwhich I did before„ÄÇ

 so I name so I'm going to look for it doesn't matter which is the file„ÄÇ

 so is not a specific I I'm not looking for a specific file„ÄÇFor that T X TÔºå then after that dash„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to use another option hereÔºå E X E C„ÄÇ So E XÔºå E CÔºå this is the option that I would like„ÄÇ

 So this is an execute command„ÄÇI'm going to execute this command after the siege„ÄÇ

Then I'm going to use the grip commandÔºå then after the grip„ÄÇBetween a single quotationÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 I'm going„ÄÇSearch for„ÄÇThe world marsh„ÄÇ Then I closed the„ÄÇThetation mark the single quotation mark„ÄÇ

So the single„ÄÇQuotation mark here„ÄÇ Then after thatÔºå what I'm going to use that with the prices„ÄÇ

I have to do like that„ÄÇ dance spaceÔºå then the back slashÔºå then semicollon„ÄÇ

So we need to understand the structure if I would like to use the execute command„ÄÇ

This is how it works„ÄÇSo I'm going to use the execute in order to run another command„ÄÇ

After the or the search command„ÄÇThen„ÄÇGriipÔºå so what I'm going to do grip the word marsh„ÄÇ

 Then I have to close it with the pricess„ÄÇSpaceÔºå then the back slash in a semi hit enter„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we got„ÄÇThe keyword Mosh„ÄÇ I can to do„ÄÇ I can also do it for another word„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå April„ÄÇI hit enter„ÄÇ and as we can seeÔºå we get the same output„ÄÇ

Wch is that one keyword hereÔºå if I have„ÄÇThe keyword in a different X file„ÄÇ Let's do it here„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå let' see what we have„ÄÇAnd is that ill„ÄÇAnd catch„ÄÇI will do here for the number„ÄÇ

So I'm going to addÔºå for exampleÔºå here„ÄÇWhat„ÄÇAPÔºå for example„ÄÇ

Then I'm going to close this one and save the file„ÄÇSo let's just check that we have here„ÄÇ

 the keyword and here the month„ÄÇOkayÔºå so we have„ÄÇThe keywords and these two files„ÄÇ So in this case„ÄÇ

 if I'm going to do the search share„ÄÇDefined it means that I'm going get two outcomes„ÄÇ hit enter„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we got two„ÄÇWhatat's of April„ÄÇNow lets move fun„ÄÇÏ†ÑÏïÑ comment„ÄÇ

So the another command is the same that I'm going to use the execute commandÔºå but in this case„ÄÇ

 I would like to copy„ÄÇAll that takess„ÄÇDash I needÔºå so I have the phrase optionÔºå the type„ÄÇFreÔºå then„ÄÇ

Agnore case„ÄÇ doesn't matter your uppercase or our case„ÄÇ Then between double quotation„ÄÇ

 I'm going to do star at T X T„ÄÇ So I'm going to look for all the text files„ÄÇDoest matter the name„ÄÇ

 What before the Dsti„ÄÇThe extension hereÔºå then E„ÄÇ So I'm going to execute„ÄÇ

And I'm going to use the copyÔºå So what I'm going to do„ÄÇ

 I'm going to copy all the text files in this current working directory„ÄÇTo where„ÄÇ

To a directory under the slash home„ÄÇSo here in this caseÔºå since we're going to use the C„ÄÇ

 which is the copyÔºå then I have to use the prices„ÄÇBefore„ÄÇÂÆ∂„ÄÇ

Directory that I would like to save all the files inside that directorÔºå then„ÄÇSpaceÔºå then back„ÄÇ

 slash semi column hit enter„ÄÇAnd it is dash L„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå NowÔºå first we have to create„ÄÇ

 I didn't create the„ÄÇThe directory I'm going to create the directory here„ÄÇ

making director we can fast exist„ÄÇ OÔºå let me remove that director first D I r„ÄÇ

Then I'm going to make the director here„ÄÇüòîÔºåPerfectÔºå then I'm going to run the command again„ÄÇ

As we can see here„ÄÇWe copied all the text files„ÄÇTo this directory„ÄÇSo we're going to reboot„ÄÇ

 so find this current current work and the type itss file then„ÄÇDash I name„ÄÇ So the ignore case„ÄÇ

 it doesn't matter this between the quotation mark„ÄÇ

 So all the text files that has the extension that dx„ÄÇ

 it doesn't matter ignore the names so all the names here or the numbers„ÄÇ

 then since we're going to use the execute„ÄÇCopyÔºå so once you're going to use another command„ÄÇ

Then we have to use this the pressesÔºå we're going to use the presses with the copy here„ÄÇ

 and then after the pressesÔºå we're going to use the direction sheet that we would like to save all the filess„ÄÇ

To this strategy and we don't forget that we have to close„ÄÇÂ∞±„ÄÇ

The execute command with the back slash in a semi„ÄÇ Let's go inside OkÔºå L S dash L„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we have this director„ÄÇI'm going to go inside this galaxy„ÄÇIt is dash„ÄÇ

As we can see here„ÄÇWhat we didÔºå we copied all„ÄÇThe files from the current working directory to this directory„ÄÇ

Bwg„ÄÇAs you can see hereÔºå we are under this current working direction„ÄÇNowÔºå let's move on to next„ÄÇ

CommandÔºå so since I'm inside this current working directoryÔºå what I'm going to do here„ÄÇ

I'm going to delete all the files in this current working directorÔºå so BWD„ÄÇ

 this is the current working director right now„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇFind just carry to working director„ÄÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÑ name„ÄÇThen„ÄÇ

going to do the T X T„ÄÇ So the I names ignore case doesn't matter upper or lower case„ÄÇ than all the„ÄÇ

Phi that has the extension that Tx T„ÄÇThen„ÄÇExecute„ÄÇPerfect RM dash RFf„ÄÇ

 because I would like to delete all the files in this current working directory here„ÄÇ

Then what I'm going to do after thatÔºå close the presses„ÄÇIn space„ÄÇThen what I'm going to do„ÄÇ

This is the backslash semicollon„ÄÇH entered a list dash„ÄÇ As we can see here„ÄÇ

 we don't have any file because we removed all the text files from this„ÄÇCurrent working director„ÄÇ

If I would like to find more information about this find commandÔºå I cant go to the manb„ÄÇ

 as we can see hereÔºå we can get all the details and the options and also about this command„ÄÇ

As you can see over here„ÄÇThe dash execute in the command so we can get more information about how to use and also here how to use this command with„ÄÇ

The prices and plus„ÄÇ and you can see here can use it with this back slashÔºå as we can see over here„ÄÇ

Here in thisÔºå we can use the prices and with„ÄÇËØ∂„ÄÇB slash„ÄÇOkayÔºå let's conclude our session„ÄÇ

Thank you and see you in the next lesson„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to create a hard link and a soft link„ÄÇ

The first thing I'm going to talk about is a hard link„ÄÇ

We can define a hard link as an exact replica of a fire„ÄÇDifferent names for the exact same file„ÄÇ

Hard links have the same i notes number and the actual file contents„ÄÇIf I remove the original file„ÄÇ

 then the link doesn't get affected and it shows the contents of the file„ÄÇ

If I'm going to remove any linkÔºå it doesn't affect other links„ÄÇHowever„ÄÇ

 it will only affect or reduce the lane count„ÄÇWe can not create hard links for directories„ÄÇ

Let's create a directory and also I'm going to create a text file inside the directory„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to undo make directoryÔºå then I'm going to call this hard linkÔºå C D hard link touch„ÄÇ

File the T X T and CA file that T TÔºå as we can see over you„ÄÇ

 we don't have any text inside this text file„ÄÇ Now I'm going to create the hard link So L M„ÄÇ

This is the command for creating a hard link„ÄÇhen the name of the text file then is the short name I'm going to use F1„ÄÇ

Hitch enter„ÄÇ then I'm going to add a text to„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇAnd new link here if one„ÄÇSo I'm going to say hello„ÄÇ

 what„ÄÇTo a1 catÔºå F1 cat file that T TÔºå as we can see over hereÔºå we do have the same„ÄÇ

Contents inside this inside these text filesÔºå I also can do the same thing here„ÄÇ

Red hat and sent to O S„ÄÇ going to about2 the file the T T card file the T T„ÄÇThen cat a one„ÄÇ

As you can see over hereÔºå we do have the same content in both files„ÄÇ

If I'm going to rundocom LS dash LISÔºå so the dash I„ÄÇ

Prince the index number of each file and as for the size„ÄÇ As we can see here on the screen„ÄÇ

 we do have the same ionoid number„ÄÇ This is the Ioid number„ÄÇAnd also we„ÄÇHave the same„ÄÇ

File permissions in both text files„ÄÇ We're going to talk about the file permissions in the next chapter„ÄÇ

We also have the same„ÄÇSize for both text fights„ÄÇThe Ioid number„ÄÇIs the an number„ÄÇ

 This number is the data structure that contains information information and attributes about file under directories„ÄÇ

 this information attributesÔºå for exampleÔºå file typesÔºå permissionsÔºå user I group ID number of links„ÄÇ

For exampleÔºå softlink and hardlinkÔºå file size and time stamps„ÄÇNowÔºå let's move on„ÄÇ

And could year and remove„ÄÇI'm going to remove the original file right now„ÄÇRM„ÄÇ

 this is the original file here„ÄÇOrM„ÄÇThen the file the T T„ÄÇHeang L S dash ill„ÄÇÂìé„ÄÇ

As we can see over hereÔºå we still have the same ion numberÔºå however„ÄÇAs you can see„ÄÇ

 I mentioned at the beginning of this session„ÄÇThis is the only thing that affected„ÄÇ

It's the link count is going to reduce„ÄÇ We used to have two„ÄÇAnd right nowÔºå we have only what„ÄÇ

The second thing I'm going to talk about is a soft drink right now„ÄÇ

 we're going to move on to the soft link„ÄÇSoftlink is also called samp link if we hear a sic link„ÄÇ

 it means a soft link„ÄÇBasicallyÔºå it's a file that points to another file„ÄÇ

It's like a shortcut in Microsoft 20s„ÄÇBoth the soft link and original file have different ideal notess„ÄÇ

In the hard linkÔºå we have the same Iode numberÔºå but in the soft link„ÄÇ

And the original file doesn't have the same„ÄÇI note number„ÄÇ

Softlinknk has the bath for the original fileÔºå but not the content„ÄÇ

If I'm going to remove the soft print„ÄÇIs not going to affect the original file„ÄÇHowever„ÄÇ

 when I remove the original fileÔºå the soft link will be useless„ÄÇAnd it points to non existing5„ÄÇ

We can„ÄÇCreate a soft drink forÔºå fire and energy„ÄÇNow I'm going to create a new directory„ÄÇ

And I'm going to call this one soft link„ÄÇCÔºå DÔºå soft linkÔºå clear the screen„ÄÇ

 and I'm going to create a file here at X file touch„ÄÇfi„ÄÇThe dD„ÄÇI'm going to hit enter right now„ÄÇ

And I'm going to do the same thing„ÄÇ Let me run LSliI„ÄÇSo you can see if this is the I number„ÄÇ

This is the link count„ÄÇNowÔºå I'm going to„ÄÇBefore I'm going to add a text to this file„ÄÇ

 I'm going to create the soft ringÔºå so the soft drink„ÄÇ

Its basically the only difference between the soft ring and the hard link„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to type the same command„ÄÇ Then for the soft ringÔºå I'm going to type dash S„ÄÇ

 This is it means a sample link or a soft link„ÄÇThen the name of the five file de takesty and also I'm going to give like a short name„ÄÇ

L F1„ÄÇHit enter EllisÔºå dash M IÔºå hit enterÔºå as we can see over here„ÄÇWe do have„ÄÇDifferent„ÄÇ

 I know numbers in the soft link here„ÄÇAnd the symbolic link has„ÄÇThis is the simplelins„ÄÇ

 You can see the difference that that we used to have for the hardlink„ÄÇIt has L„ÄÇ

This is the symbolic link„ÄÇ This is before the permission„ÄÇ This is the permission„ÄÇ

 As I said that we' are going to talk about the permission in the next chapter„ÄÇ

 this is represent the link„ÄÇThe permissions also areÔºå as we can seeÔºå also are different„ÄÇ

 We have different permissions for„ÄÇThe soft link and the original file„ÄÇIf I'm going to add a text„ÄÇ

 let me add a text echo„ÄÇThenÔºå helloÔºå what„ÄÇTo the symbolic link or the soft link„ÄÇCatchÔºå if one„ÄÇ

Rat filed the text„ÄÇ As we can see over hereÔºå we do have the same content„ÄÇAnd both files„ÄÇ

Now let's remove the original file„ÄÇAs I sit„ÄÇWhen I explain the soft link or the symbolic link„ÄÇ

When I remove the soft link„ÄÇIs not going to affect the original file„ÄÇHowever„ÄÇ

 when are you remove the original fileÔºüThe soft link will be useless„ÄÇ this one will be useless„ÄÇ

And it points to an unexisting file„ÄÇLet's do an example„ÄÇ So R M„ÄÇI'm going to„ÄÇ

Remove the original 5 H enter LS dash LÔºå as we can see over here„ÄÇI said that„ÄÇ

The samplepoic link will be useless and it points to an existing file„ÄÇ and if I'm going to„ÄÇü§¢„ÄÇ

To display the content of the F1„ÄÇHitch enterÔºå as we can see over here„ÄÇüòÆÔºåWhat it shows me„ÄÇ

 it shows me that there is no such file or a„ÄÇBecause of what„ÄÇ

 because we have removed the original file„ÄÇThus conclude our session„ÄÇ

 Thank you and see you on the next lesson„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use G Edit Editor and Na Editor„ÄÇ

G edit it's a powerful graphical user interface text editor„ÄÇ

It's the defaultex editor of Agnom desktopktop environment„ÄÇ

There are some features of using G Edit EdorÔºå for example„ÄÇ

Highlighting syntax of programming languages and do reviewÔºå search replaceÔºå fonts and colors„ÄÇ

If I would like to open up a file in G it simpleÔºå I just can type the command G8„ÄÇ

 then the name of the file file 1 T T so we can create a new text file„ÄÇ

 or I can just type the command G8 after I finished typing for example here will„ÄÇTo real it„ÄÇÂóØT hello„ÄÇ

Or then if I would like to save the fileÔºå I can hit the button save here„ÄÇ

If I would like to delete simpleÔºå its a graphical user interfacefas editor I would like to find more option about the G Edit editor here we can find this is the option that we can use for the G editit editor„ÄÇ

NowÔºå I'm going to save the file„ÄÇFile that TxtÔºå I'm going to call this one file 1„ÄÇTheing C save„ÄÇ

Close the file„ÄÇThen LS LÔºå as we can see over hereÔºå this is the T file„ÄÇThat we just have created„ÄÇ

I'm going to open in„ÄÇShow the content of the text fileÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 this is the content inside this text file„ÄÇNow let's move on to the second editor„ÄÇThe nano editor„ÄÇ

It's a very friendly and popular command Linux text editor„ÄÇAnd it's really simple to use„ÄÇ

And if I would like to open up a file„ÄÇIn nano simpleÔºå I just type the command nanono„ÄÇ

Then the name of the fileÔºå for exampleÔºå file  oneÔºå let X hit enter„ÄÇAnd as you can see here„ÄÇ

 this is the nano Ed„ÄÇ If I would like to exit I„ÄÇ'm going to hit control X„ÄÇ So to exit the file„ÄÇ

 Now I'm going to create a new file„ÄÇ NaÔºå just I'm going to type the nano command hit enter„ÄÇ

 I'm going to type Na editor„ÄÇIt's a fair„ÄÇFriendly„ÄÇdext„ÄÇDe this serve„ÄÇAnd just maybe type welcome„ÄÇ

2 nano„ÄÇEdjectitive„ÄÇalso hereÔºå Hello world„ÄÇafter I'm done writing think if I would like to save the file so I can hit the bottom control„ÄÇ

 then oh in order to save or right to the file is going to give me an option as we can see find name to right„ÄÇ

 and I'm going to call this one file to that t exists„ÄÇTep enterer„ÄÇ

 we saved the content and we have created a new„ÄÇTix file„ÄÇIf I would like to get help„ÄÇ

I'm going to press control thenÔºå as we can see over hereÔºå control G„ÄÇ

As we can see if this is the help page of the„ÄÇNanno editorÔºå if I would like to close the help page„ÄÇ

 control XÔºå as we can see over hereÔºå this is„ÄÇeverything„ÄÇ

 like if you're going to use any of those lettersÔºå we have to use the control before„ÄÇThose litter„ÄÇ

For exampleÔºå if I would like to move„ÄÇLet me move the cursor here„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 if I would like to move the cursor to the end of the filesÔºå I'm going to„ÄÇHit button and control E„ÄÇ

 as we can seeÔºå we move the cursor to the end„ÄÇ now I'm going to move it to the beginningÔºå so C a„ÄÇ

If I would like to scroll to the next pageÔºå I know that I don't have like an next page here„ÄÇ

 but for your informationÔºå control YÔºå if I would like to scroll to the previous pageÔºå control V„ÄÇ

If I would like to search or find some text„ÄÇSoÔºå I'm going to hit control„ÄÇW„ÄÇ

I'm going to search for the worldÔºå for example„ÄÇNo know„ÄÇhi entered as you can see this is the cursor„ÄÇ

Move to the first„ÄÇSearch of the first word text that we„ÄÇLooked for Now let's move on„ÄÇ

 if I would like to delete the character at the cursor position„ÄÇ So here I'm going to delete the n„ÄÇ

 So control D„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to cut the current line„ÄÇSo control O„ÄÇI go down here„ÄÇ

 if I would like to„ÄÇBest„ÄÇThe lineÔºå So I'm going to„ÄÇHit the bottom control„ÄÇ then you„ÄÇ

As we can see here„ÄÇIf I would like to read from another file at the cursor position„ÄÇ

So I'm going to hit control R„ÄÇThen file1 that takes D„ÄÇ So I'm going to bring the content„ÄÇ

And the file1 that62„ÄÇThe file2 that60 attentionÔºå as we can see here„ÄÇ

 this is the content of the file 1 that60„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to replace a word or a term„ÄÇ

So I'm going to have to controlÔºå then the„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇBack slash„ÄÇAs we can seeÔºå search will replace a nano„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to„ÄÇSearch for the world„ÄÇA N o„ÄÇThen hit enter„ÄÇ now I said replace width„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to type9 or like that„ÄÇAll of them are uppercase hit enter iss going to give me the option right now„ÄÇ

Replace this„ÄÇ in instance as it is or noÔºå if you want to do it all„ÄÇ so just press a„ÄÇ

Don't press control aÔºå yes aÔºå the lit a„ÄÇAs you can see over hereÔºå we have replaced the word2„ÄÇ

ÏïÑÂÆù Ïù¥Î†áÍ≤åÏä§ ÎÇò„ÄÇNowÔºå if I would like to go to a specific lineÔºå so I'm going to hit control„ÄÇ

 then the question mark„ÄÇAs you can see it enter the line number„ÄÇCall in numbersÔºå So I'm going to„ÄÇ

Move the cursor to line 3„ÄÇH enterÔºå as we can see over hereÔºå so move the cursor to line 3„ÄÇ

 I can do itÔºå for exampleÔºå to line 10„ÄÇAs we can see hereÔºå we move the cursor to line1„ÄÇ

That conclude our session„ÄÇ Thank you and see you on the next lesson„ÄÇHelloÔºå everyone„ÄÇIn this demo„ÄÇ

 I'm going to show you how to use VI Edor„ÄÇThe VI editoror is the most popular text editor in the Linux distributions„ÄÇ

VI considers the number one choice for the most Linux ci admitmins„ÄÇ

There is an advanced version of the VI editor and it's called them VIM„ÄÇ

And it's the short for the VI improved„ÄÇThe VI of Vm is a user friendly and it's available in most Linux distributions„ÄÇ

And it works the same among Linux distributions„ÄÇJust in case if we don't have that„ÄÇ

The V I improved or the same version on my system„ÄÇ I can„ÄÇAnd it started by running this command„ÄÇ

Yum and install then then„ÄÇIf I would like to open up a file and them or V I just documentÔºå then„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå then file 1 that T T Cat enter„ÄÇAs you can seeÔºå this is the„ÄÇThem environment or editor„ÄÇ

NowÔºå if I would like to type any wordÔºå it will not do anything because the VI editor or the Vm has two different working modes„ÄÇ

It has the command mode and the insert mode„ÄÇWhen Fer I open the VI editorÔºå it opens the command mode„ÄÇ

 this is the command mode right now„ÄÇSo in a command modeÔºå I can only do just move the cursor„ÄÇ

 scroll down between pagesesÔºå I can delete charactersÔºå wordsÔºå linesÔºå I can copy„ÄÇCutting and pasting„ÄÇ

 searching and replacing„ÄÇAnd saving think I can save also my changes after I„ÄÇDo any change and„ÄÇ

This6 five„ÄÇThe insert modeÔºå this is the second type„ÄÇWe only can insert tick into the file„ÄÇ

When I would like to switch between the mosÔºå for exampleÔºå from the night„ÄÇ
