Welcome backï¼Œ everyoneã€‚ This is Mattã€‚ And in this videoï¼Œ we're going to finish up Section 7ã€‚

 which is create Ansible plays and playbooksã€‚ And what we're going to do is put together a lot of the things we've learned into a large playbook and then execute that against our managed nodesã€‚

 So let's head over to Section 7ã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And then the final lessonï¼Œ which is create playbooks to configure systems to a specified stateã€‚

 So in our diagramï¼Œ I have provided the example playbook that we're going to be creating and then runningã€‚

But before we get into creating our playbookï¼Œ I did want to show you Im in my working directory and I've also created a template file within a template directory that I createdã€‚

It's just called index dot J2ã€‚And this is just a simple indexã€‚

t HTML that's choosing the Ansipible host name variable in order to display the host name of the server that we're hittingã€‚

And this is going to come into play on the task that we're using the template module forã€‚

 but I just want to show you that I already created thatï¼Œ so if you're following alongã€‚

 feel free to go ahead and create that as wellã€‚And now we can go ahead and get startedã€‚

So within playbooksï¼Œ I'm just going to create a playbook that is called deployã€‚ymlã€‚

And to get it startedï¼Œ we're going to start off with our three dashesã€‚

And then the first play that we're going to create is going to run against our web servers groupã€‚

We're going to be doing some privilege tasks so we're going to become and set that to yesã€‚

And then we can define our tasksã€‚So the first task is going to be installing Apacheã€‚For thatã€‚

 we're going to use the young moduleã€‚I'm going to specify the name of the packageï¼Œ which is HttPDã€‚

And then for stateï¼Œ we're going to use latestã€‚We're going to come back and run another taskã€‚

And the description for this is going to be create user and add them to the Apache groupã€‚

It's actually going to be create usersã€‚And add them to the Apache groupã€‚So for thatã€‚

 we're going to use the user moduleã€‚And for nameï¼Œ we're actually going to be performing a loopã€‚

 So we're going to put in our variableã€‚Which is itemã€‚

We're also going to specify groups so we can add these users to the Apache groupã€‚

then we'll come back to the same indentation as userã€‚ we're going to specify loopã€‚

And then we'll define the items in that loopï¼Œ which is going to be willã€‚And thenï¼Œ milesã€‚

Then we have another taskã€‚And this is to create the index dot HTMLã€‚And for thisã€‚

 we're going to use the template moduleï¼Œ so we're actually going to be pushing out that template that we createdã€‚

So the source is going to be homeã€‚Cloud_ userï¼Œ Ansibleã€‚And then templatesã€‚And then index dot J2ã€‚

And then for destinationï¼Œ and this is where it's going to be going on our manage nodesã€‚Far Www HTMLã€‚

of courseï¼Œ index do HTMLã€‚And we want this file to be owned by Apacheã€‚And alsoï¼Œ the Apache groupã€‚

AndFor permissionsï¼Œ we're going to set this to0644ã€‚

And then our last task is going to be starting and enablingã€‚The HtTPD serviceã€‚

We use the service moduleã€‚Name is HttPDã€‚State is going to be startedã€‚

And then enabled is going to be set to yesã€‚And one thing that we could have done with this playbook is add a handler in so that way if we updated something like the HttPdã€‚

comï¼Œ then it would kick off a restartï¼Œ but for this exampleã€‚

 we're just going to make sure that the service is started and enabledã€‚

 but just keep in mind that that is something you can do especially if you want to make your playbook item potentã€‚

 which is what is recommended to do for all playbooks that way you can run it as many times as you want and you're always going to get the same resultsã€‚

But in this playbookï¼Œ we're not updating the configuration fileã€‚

 so we're just going to keep it as isã€‚And also while we're on the subjectã€‚

 one great thing about playbooks is you can build out a playbook that you think is going to handle all your needsã€‚

 but then you realize that you actually need something else to get your machines to a specified stateã€‚

And the great thing about having a base playbook is you can always add to it to make sure that it meets your specificationsã€‚

 Alrightï¼Œ so that's going to finish out this play for the Web servers groupã€‚

 but we're not finished quite yetã€‚ So let's head over to the next pageã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And now we're going to configure another play that's going to run against our DB servers groupã€‚

So let's go back to the command lineã€‚This timeï¼Œ the host group will be DB serversã€‚Againã€‚

 we're going to become the root userã€‚And now we can specify our tasksã€‚

So the first thing that we want to do is install PostresqLã€‚We'll use the young moduleã€‚

Name is going to be post GesqLã€‚Dash serverã€‚Then state is going to be latestã€‚

And then in order to start up and use our Postgresql databaseï¼Œ we need to initialize the Db clusterã€‚

SoWe'll say name and we'll just say initialize Db clusterã€‚For thisã€‚

 we're going to use the command moduleï¼Œ and this is going to allow us to run user binã€‚Postreqlã€‚

Set upï¼Œ and then we'll pass it a net Dbã€‚And then we can create our database usersã€‚

We'll use the user moduleã€‚And the nameï¼Œ againï¼Œ we're going to use a loopã€‚ So we're going have ourã€‚

Item variableã€‚And for groupsï¼Œ we want to add these users to the Postgres groupã€‚

And we're going to create a loopã€‚

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_5.png)

And then specify our usersã€‚This is going to be Coryã€‚Andï¼Œ Aaronã€‚We're going to come backã€‚

And our final task is going to be starting and enabling the Postgres serviceã€‚So start and enableã€‚

Postgresã€‚We'll use the service moduleã€‚The name of the service is Post rescuescuLã€‚

And the state is startedã€‚And enabled is going to equalï¼Œ yesã€‚All rightï¼Œ now before we save and quitã€‚

 I'm going to take a quick look over thisã€‚And after just a quick scanã€‚

 I noticed that for my host set that to Deb serversã€‚

So I guess would be fine if they're running Deianï¼Œ which they're notã€‚Now we have it as Db serversã€‚

Let's scrollcro down just a bit moreã€‚

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_7.png)

And everything looks fine off the batï¼Œ but if we run into issuesã€‚

 we can always troubleshoot those togetherã€‚And the last thing I wanted to mention before we save is that you can always add in blocks in order to group your taologicallyã€‚

 which as we learned in the last video is a great way to handle any errors that you might encounterã€‚

 So now let's go ahead and save this and quitã€‚Take a deep breath and then we can run our playbookã€‚

It's going to be playbook and then deploy do YMlã€‚All rightï¼Œ here we goã€‚

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_10.png)

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_11.png)

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_12.png)

And if you can believe itï¼Œ our playbook completed successfullyã€‚

 So let's just walk through this real quickã€‚

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_14.png)

As you can see it's going to start off our first playï¼Œ which executing it's a web service groupã€‚

 it's going to gather our factsã€‚

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_16.png)

Then it installs Apache on MSParson 4 and 3ã€‚

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_18.png)

It also creates our two usersï¼Œ Will and Milesã€‚

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_20.png)

And then we use the template module to create the index dot HTMLã€‚



![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_22.png)

And then we start and enable HtTPDã€‚ And so that finishes out our first playã€‚

 and then our second playï¼Œ executing against the DB server groupã€‚



![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_24.png)

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_25.png)

It's going to gather factsã€‚And then install Postresqlã€‚



![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_27.png)

Then we're going to initialize the Db clusterã€‚And then create our usersã€‚



![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_29.png)

You can also add them to the Postgre groupã€‚

![](img/b3336e1f0d703117dc070a3a6e93f2b2_31.png)

And then finallyï¼Œ start and enable Postgresã€‚Wellï¼Œ that's going to finish up this lesson on createate playbooks to configure systems to a specified stateã€‚

 so let's go ahead and mark it complete and then we can move on to using ansible modules for system administration tasksã€‚
