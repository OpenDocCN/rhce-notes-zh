In this videoÔºå we are going to talk about bash scripting„ÄÇ

 This video is gonna be a little bit longer than previous videosÔºå but I promise you„ÄÇ

 it is gonna be worth it at the end of this video„ÄÇ If you watch this video till the end„ÄÇ

 I guarantee it that you will know about bash scripting more than a lot more people„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so without a further adoÔºå let's start„ÄÇ So these are the 22 specific topic that we have selected for you„ÄÇ

 So what I'm going to do that I'm going to select one topic like number one topic and then we're going to do whatever that task that we have to perform„ÄÇ

 I'm going to explain to you firstÔºå that what we will discuss in this topic„ÄÇ

 then we will discuss it and then we move on to„ÄÇüòäÔºåAnother topicÔºå the next topicÔºå essentiallyÔºå okay„ÄÇ

So let's start„ÄÇ First topic is helloba scripting So in this topic we are going to discuss what is Ba scripting and we are going to create a file in which we would write the script essentially we are going to print the hello by abash scripting we are going to allow the file to be become executable Okay„ÄÇ

 so these are the steps that we are going to perform in this topic So without a further ado„ÄÇ

 let's get started So we press controltr al okay this opens up our terminal so what we are going to do here„ÄÇ

 we are going to write here CA slash ac slash shells So what this command does is that when you press enter it shows you all the shells available on your system and you can simply use any of them„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_1.png)

So our concern is only bash scripting„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so we will only select this„ÄÇ

 So we know that bash shall exist on our distribution„ÄÇ So in order to know the path of the bash„ÄÇ

 So you'll right hereÔºå which bash and we know slash bin slash bash is the path of the„ÄÇBash shell„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so what we are going to do is that we are going to add this path in every script that we write„ÄÇ

 which is related to bashÔºå okay„ÄÇSo„ÄÇWe go to terminalÔºå okayÔºå and let me just go to desktop„ÄÇ

And we will create a file on desktop or a script„ÄÇ So right nowÔºå if we Ls here„ÄÇ

 we have nothing on our desktopÔºå our desktop is emptyyÔºå as you can see from here as well„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so what we are going to do is that we are going to create a script„ÄÇ So touch„ÄÇ

 and then let's say hello script„ÄÇDot S H„ÄÇ So we hit enter and you can see that we have Ho script here„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so now if we open it upÔºå this is hello script„ÄÇ

 So what we can do is that we are going to add that pathÔºå which is essentially slash bin slash bash„ÄÇ

 And now in here we are going to write a script„ÄÇ So we will write here„ÄÇ Ho„ÄÇBack scriptingÔºå okay„ÄÇ

So bash basically stands for born again shellll„ÄÇAnd when you do that its it's very simple„ÄÇ

 So you save it„ÄÇ And now if you Ls hereÔºå you can see that you have Helloscript dot S„ÄÇ

 So now if you go into the detailsÔºå you can see that Ho script dot S is not executable so the owner can only readwr the other groups can only you know read and the public can only read So the executable permissions are not there so we cannot really execute the script„ÄÇ

 So in order to make this script executableÔºå what we have got to do„ÄÇ

 we have to write here CHMO and then we're gonna write here let me just clear at first„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_3.png)

So we're going to write here CHMO and then we're going to plus X„ÄÇ

 which is you know which will add the executable information or executable permissions„ÄÇ

 then you're going to write here file name which is essentially the scriptÔºå hello script„ÄÇDot S„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so you hit enterÔºå you knowÔºå it doesn't give any error„ÄÇ So if we do again a less negative L„ÄÇ

 So you can see that now this file has become executable as well„ÄÇ

 And the color of it has changed okayÔºå So now we can basically execute this script and we can see your result„ÄÇ

 So let's go ahead and let's try to execute our file„ÄÇ So in order to execute this file„ÄÇ

 you just simply have to put this dot and then slash And then you can just simply write hello script dot S„ÄÇ

 you hit enter and you can see that we have got the outputÔºå which is hello bash script„ÄÇ

 So if you want to change it like hello bash„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇLinux and audience„ÄÇSo if we save this„ÄÇ

 if we come here againÔºå if we try to run our scriptÔºå you can see that this echo„ÄÇ

 that display text has changed„ÄÇ okayÔºå so now moving on to the next topic So what is our next topic Allright moving on to the next topic which is redirect to file So what we are going to learn in this topic is that how we can actually capture the output and we can send it to the file So from the shell how we can send the output to a file basically that's what we are going learn in this topic okay so let's go ahead and let's try to do that So this is our script hello script and let's say that we want this output to go into some random file that we create„ÄÇ

 we press here the angle bracket and let's call this file do text„ÄÇ

 So if we save this we go back to our terminal and let me just clear it So now„ÄÇ

What we are going to do is that we are going to run our script„ÄÇ

So you can see that it has created this file so if we go here we can see that hello bash Linux and audience the output of this file of this script has been stored in this file Okay so what else you can do you can actually take the output from this shell and you can actually store that in the file as well so now what we're gonna do that we will write here a script let's say we write here cat and then we will write here the file name which is essentially file do Txt okay so we save it and„ÄÇ

WeÔºå yeahÔºå we go ahead and we try to run our script„ÄÇ So we hit enter„ÄÇ

 and now you can see that it has become a sort of an editor„ÄÇ

 So whatever now we will write here on this shell hiÔºå this is a shell„ÄÇ This is Linux hint„ÄÇDot com„ÄÇOr„ÄÇ

Our channel of flowerss„ÄÇSo now what we are going to do that if we want to come out of it we we have to press control D okay so when we press control D we come out of it and if we go ahead and if we try to open this file it says reload so when we reload you can see that it has the output hi this is the shell„ÄÇ

 this is Linux do co or channel of far„ÄÇSo this output that we were writing here is now displayed here in this file„ÄÇ

What it has done that it has basically replaced the old text„ÄÇ

 so there is another thing that you can do if you want that text not to be replaced„ÄÇ

But you want to append the text ahead of it so what you can do just put two angle brackets so you press control S you save it and then you come here and then you try to run your script so you hit enter and it says you know put some text it has become an editor so right here okay another line of text okay so we press control D we come out of it„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_5.png)

And nowÔºå if we go back hereÔºå we open this fileÔºå you can see that it has basically added the text next to it„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so now it has appended instead of replacing„ÄÇOkayÔºå so now let's discuss third topic„ÄÇ

 which is comment„ÄÇ So in this topicÔºå we are going to perform one line comments first„ÄÇ

 we're gonna see that how we can do that„ÄÇ and then we are going to move on to creating multiple line comments as well„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå then after thatÔºå we're gonna see the here doc syntaxÔºå you knowÔºå as an additional thing„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now what we can doÔºå we go we can go back to our script„ÄÇ

 So what a comment is basically that you knowÔºå it has no value„ÄÇ So in the script„ÄÇ

 if you write a commentÔºå you knowÔºå it does nothingÔºå it just explains the code to the programmers„ÄÇ

 So for exampleÔºå if I am a programmer and if I have written a code„ÄÇ

 and I would add comment into that code because let's say if I have left the company or if I'm not there„ÄÇ

 then the other programmers could actually take a look at the code and they could understand that what„ÄÇ

That code exactly is doing„ÄÇ So that's why comments are essential„ÄÇ So for example„ÄÇ

 if I write here hash„ÄÇ and then I write hereÔºå this is a cat command„ÄÇ

 So it would have no effect on the code„ÄÇ OkayÔºå but what it is studying that this is a cat command„ÄÇ

 So this is a simple command„ÄÇ So if I uncommon this And if I save this„ÄÇ

 And if I come here and if I try to run my scriptÔºå which is hello„ÄÇ

 so you can see that it is giving an error„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so online3Ôºå there is an error„ÄÇ

 So if I just write here hashÔºå now it is a commentÔºå it has no value„ÄÇ So if I go back here„ÄÇ

 and if I try to run my scriptÔºå you can see that I can actually work with my script quite well„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now this it would add this thing to the file do textÔºå okayÔºå so„ÄÇThis is a one line comment„ÄÇ

 So what if like you have likeÔºå let's sayÔºå500 lines of code„ÄÇ How are you going do that„ÄÇ

 So you cannot actually put hash against every single line that is going to take a very long time„ÄÇ

 SoÔºå for exampleÔºå let's say we have like 10„ÄÇOkayÔºå like this„ÄÇ

 So how you can actually make all of these lines invisible or of no value by commenting them„ÄÇ

 how you can comment all at once„ÄÇ So this thing we call it as multi line commenting„ÄÇ

 So how would you do that„ÄÇ you would come hereÔºå you put a column hereÔºå you would put a space„ÄÇ

 you you knowÔºå after columnÔºå you put a single code hereÔºå and then you put a single code here as well„ÄÇ

 So now all of it has been commented and if I save it and if I go back if I run my script so you can see that there is you know these lines have no value„ÄÇ

 all of them have been commented„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so that was basically multiline comment„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now let's discuss the here doc syntax„ÄÇ So here doc is basically I would say it it is basically a phenomena that„ÄÇ

It actually helps you interact with the shell„ÄÇ SoÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 whatever we're gonna write here inside our scriptÔºå it is going to be visible on our output„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so let's try to do that„ÄÇ So for exampleÔºå let's say we have a cat come on So in here dock we're not gonna write angle bracket this way„ÄÇ

 but this wayÔºå okayÔºå and here we would have here dock delimmeter„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so the here do demeter would be like it could be anything„ÄÇ it could be hello world„ÄÇ

 it could be you know it it is similar to the variable name„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so let's call it a here dock„ÄÇText„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå so basically what it is that it is a hair do delimmeter„ÄÇ So let me you knowÔºå name it mute„ÄÇ

 something like creativeÔºå so„ÄÇLet's call it creative„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so what it is that it is a here dock diameter and it could be anything„ÄÇ So now in here„ÄÇ

 you can add any text like this is hello creative„ÄÇNextÔºå okay„ÄÇSo I can add another line„ÄÇ

 add another line„ÄÇSo now I would write here creative to end the hair dock demeter„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now if I save itÔºå I go backÔºå I try to run my script„ÄÇ

You can see that it is basically showing this is hello creative text at another line„ÄÇ

 So this was basically the concept of here doc„ÄÇ So for example„ÄÇ

 if you have any like sort of comments and if you also want to show those comments on the output„ÄÇ

 you can use this here do delimit alright and this this is here dog demeter and it could be anything like anywhere it is similar to like the variable name Okay so I hope you have got the point you have okay„ÄÇ

 so now let's come to our next topic which is conditional statements So in this topic we are going to discuss if statements if else statements if else if statements and the conditional statements of and operators and the conditional statements of our operators as well„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_7.png)

FinallyÔºå we will take a look at the case statement as well„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so let's go ahead and let's try to run all these conditional statements and let's see what are the results that we get„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so we'll go to our script and„ÄÇInside our script„ÄÇ we have this code„ÄÇ we'll remove it„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now we are going to write here the if statement„ÄÇ So before ifÔºå let's say„ÄÇ

 let's declare a variable named as let's say count and then 10„ÄÇ OkayÔºå this is the value„ÄÇ

 So if we write here if And then in order to write a condition„ÄÇ

 you have to have this these big brackets„ÄÇ And always remember to keep one space from both of the sides„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå otherwise it would give some sort of weird error„ÄÇ So you can write here equal„ÄÇ

 and then you can write here 10„ÄÇ So obviously we know that this station this statement is true„ÄÇ So„ÄÇ

We write here thenÔºå and then we' write hereÔºå echo„ÄÇSo echoÔºå let's say the condition is true„ÄÇ

 So for those of you who are not programmers who do not understand the if statements„ÄÇ

 I'm going to explain to you in deep„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so lets let's see what this thing will do„ÄÇ

 So count is a variableÔºå it has a value of 10 So what happens is that inside this if condition it checks if the count is equal to 10 Okay„ÄÇ

 so obviously the count is equal to 10„ÄÇ So this condition is true„ÄÇ So if that condition is true„ÄÇ

 only in that caseÔºå it would execute this blockÔºå which is after10 okay„ÄÇ

 so I hope you have got the point„ÄÇ so now if we just save it if we go back to a terminal and if we try to run our script„ÄÇ

 you can see that it says the condition is true„ÄÇ so let's try to change this„ÄÇ

 let's say let's you know„ÄÇNowMake it false on purpose„ÄÇ So equal 9„ÄÇ if we save it„ÄÇ

 if we try to run our script againÔºå you can see that it does not give any output and the reason is that we do not have an else block right„ÄÇ

 the if statementÔºå the conditionÔºå the cursorÔºå the program doesn't know what to do if the condition is false„ÄÇ

 So for thatÔºå we have„ÄÇThis thing right hereÔºå else block„ÄÇ And in else block„ÄÇ

 you can write the condition„ÄÇIs false„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so the idea is that now what would happen that it would execute the else block because if block wasn't true„ÄÇ

 So now you can see that it it is showing here the condition is false„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I hope you've got the point„ÄÇ So there are other things that you can do but before that let me explain to you again„ÄÇ

 So count is equal to 10„ÄÇ So count is not equal to 9 because count is 10 here„ÄÇ

 So obviously 10 is not equal to 9„ÄÇ So this block cannot be executed at any cost because this is not this if condition is not true„ÄÇ

 So what it will do that it will skip this block and it will come here„ÄÇ

 and if it will basically print out this else block„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so you can actually check here not equal to as wellÔºå which is an E okay„ÄÇ

 so an E stands for not equal„ÄÇ So obviously this condition is gonna be true now because we have 9„ÄÇ

So obviously9 is not equal to 10 Another thing that you can do is that you can write here GT„ÄÇ

 which stands for greater than and obviously if you will go ahead if you run your script„ÄÇ

 this would say the condition is true because 10 is greater than 9 okay so„ÄÇ

You can use angle brackets as well„ÄÇ so if you want to use an angle bracket like this„ÄÇ

 so count is greater than 9„ÄÇ So what you've got to do that you have to just replace these big brackets with these brackets„ÄÇ

 Okay small brackets alrightÔºå so now if I save this obviously we know that 10 is greater than 9„ÄÇ

 so the condition is going to be„ÄÇTrue okayÔºå so the condition is true„ÄÇ Let's try to make it false„ÄÇ

 So if weÔºå you know change the angle bracketÔºå if we save itÔºå if we go back„ÄÇ

 if we try to run our stripÔºå now you can see that it says the condition is false„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so obviously10 cannot be less than 9 alrightÔºå so you can also have if elseÔºå if statements as well„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so how you can work with themÔºå let me show you let's say that we want to put another check„ÄÇ

 So how would we doÔºå we would write here else if„ÄÇAnd let me justÔºå you knowÔºå have an else block here„ÄÇ

 Then we' write here then„ÄÇ and then we write here E„ÄÇ and let's say the condition„ÄÇIs true„ÄÇAnd in here„ÄÇ

 we put a condition like„ÄÇYou know„ÄÇGot„ÄÇIs less than„ÄÇOr equal toÔºå let's say9„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so we know that this condition is not trueÔºå rightÔºü So what would happen that the cursor would come„ÄÇ

 It would check obviously 10 is not less than 9„ÄÇ It would skip this and it would come again here and obviously the 10 is not less than 9 and it is„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå it is neither less than 9 nor equal to 9Ôºå obviously„ÄÇ

 so this block will be skipped as well„ÄÇ and then it will only execute this thing here„ÄÇ

 E is equal to the condition is false„ÄÇ obviously okayÔºå so I hope you have got the point here„ÄÇ

So now we'll press control S and we'll go here and we'll see what we can do with this„ÄÇ

 So if we run the scriptÔºå you can see that the condition is false„ÄÇ

 So let's say if we write here greater than 9„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so now what would happen„ÄÇ

 let me write here second„ÄÇPredition„ÄÇIs true„ÄÇ Let me write here„ÄÇ First condition„ÄÇIs true„ÄÇ

 and I received it„ÄÇLet me just save it and if we go back„ÄÇAnd let me clear it if we run our strip„ÄÇ

 you can see that it says second condition is true„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so that's how you can work with else if as well„ÄÇ So till now we have discussed if statement we have discussed if else statements and we have also discussed if else if statements as well Okay„ÄÇ

 so I hope you have got the point So now let's move on and let's try to discuss and operator So how can we work with the and operator So that's pretty simple as well„ÄÇ

 So let me just remove all of that„ÄÇCountÔºå let'sÔºå let's make it as let's say age„ÄÇ

 So age is equal to 10„ÄÇ Let's say„ÄÇ And we write here„ÄÇ And if conditionÔºå if the age isÔºå let's say„ÄÇ

 let me write here„ÄÇ double chs„ÄÇ and then the„ÄÇYou knowÔºå variable nameÔºå which is essentially8„ÄÇ

Let's say if 8 is greater than 18„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇThenÔºå we write here„ÄÇÂïä„ÄÇDouble quotes and right hereÔºå H„ÄÇ

And then we'll write here less than„ÄÇ and then we'll write here 40„ÄÇSo„ÄÇ

What this condition would do it it would check if the age is greater than 18 and if it is less than 40„ÄÇ

 only then it would execute whatever is inside the if block„ÄÇ So right here echo„ÄÇAge is correct„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so else with say„ÄÇE go„ÄÇ8„ÄÇIs not correct„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇThen we'll close the if block or the if statement So right now we we know our areas 1„ÄÇ

 so obviously this statement will not be correct because in order to execute this block both of these condition conditions have to be true okay so„ÄÇ

If that condition alone is true and that is not trueÔºå then obviously„ÄÇ

 this block is not going to be executed„ÄÇ So at the same timeÔºå simultaneously„ÄÇ

 these two conditions have to be true„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so right now„ÄÇ

 we know that none of the condition is true„ÄÇ So obviously„ÄÇ

 it is going to execute this one age is not correct„ÄÇ So we press control S„ÄÇ we go ahead„ÄÇ

 We try to run our script„ÄÇ So now you can see that it is giving some sort of error„ÄÇAt line 5„ÄÇ

 so let's see what the error is„ÄÇSo I think the error is that we have not given space here„ÄÇ So okay„ÄÇ

 so that's what I was talking about previously„ÄÇ So now let's go ahead„ÄÇ

 let's try to execute our script„ÄÇ So you can see that it says age is not correct because both of the conditions are not true„ÄÇ

 So let's now let's try to make one condition true but let's try to make another condition false„ÄÇ

 So logically let's say we say age is less than let's say 15„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so now automatically„ÄÇ

 obviously age is less than 15„ÄÇ this condition is true„ÄÇ but this is not true„ÄÇ OkayÔºå this is false„ÄÇ

 age is not greater than 18„ÄÇ So againÔºå it would not execute this one„ÄÇ it would execute this one„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so if we control less hereÔºå we go aheadÔºå we try to run our script„ÄÇ we hit enter„ÄÇ

 you can see that it says age is not correct„ÄÇ So againÔºå it has not executed this block„ÄÇ

 It has executed this block rather and„ÄÇObviouslyÔºå this condition is true„ÄÇ

 but this condition is not trueÔºå So both of the conditions have to be true„ÄÇ

So now let's write here greater less than„ÄÇ and let's sayÔºå let's do it 40„ÄÇ and let's change it to„ÄÇ

 let's say 30„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so now what would happen that age is greater than 18„ÄÇ YesÔºå it is true„ÄÇ

 age is less than 40„ÄÇ YesÔºå it is true as well„ÄÇ So what's going happen that this thing is going to be executed„ÄÇ

 it would say age is correct„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so we press control S we save it„ÄÇ

 we go back to our terminal and we try to run our script and if we hit enterÔºå it says age is correct„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so I hope you have got the point„ÄÇSo now what we are going to do is that we can actually do something like this„ÄÇ

 So if we just remove this you know these brackets from here„ÄÇAnd if we put double brackets„ÄÇ

 then it would give us the same result OkayÔºå so that is just another way to do the same thing„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 that is just a difference in syntax„ÄÇ So if we you know run our script we would get the same result okay so there is another way that you can do if you just write here negative a or hyphen a with single brackets„ÄÇ

 then it would work as well„ÄÇ So if we press control SÔºå we go back we try to run our script„ÄÇ

 you can see that it has not changedÔºå it is giving us the same result„ÄÇ

 So these are basically three synt to write down the and command okay or the and operator and work with it alright so I hope you have got the point you have learned something new regarding this so now let's move on to the or operator So let's keep everything same so our operator is basically if you write here„ÄÇ

Or0„ÄÇSo it means that one of those two statements have to be true like either it it has to be true or it has to be true in order to execute this block so„ÄÇ

This is negative O it is it is being used for the or operator so now the age is 30 both of conditions are true so obviously this block will execute so let's go ahead and let's try„ÄÇ

You can see that it says age is correct„ÄÇ So now let's make one of them false„ÄÇ

 So let's say we we made this false intentionally„ÄÇ So now you can see that obviously this block is this statement„ÄÇ

 this condition is false and this condition is true but still it would execute it because one condition is true„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so R means only one OkayÔºå this one or this one So we press control S we go back„ÄÇ

 we try to run our script again and you can see that it says age is correct„ÄÇ

So the only way this is gonna be false is that both of them are false Okay„ÄÇ

 so let's make it let's make it something like this negative Gt„ÄÇ

 it means that a is greater than 40 and age is less than 18„ÄÇ

 so obviously both of the statements are not correct now so you press control S we go back to our terminal and if we try to run on our script you can see that it says8 is not correct because both of the conditions are false now okay so I hope you have got the point and similarly you can actually write the or operator like this by writing here double„ÄÇ

PippesÔºå okayÔºå pipe sign„ÄÇ and then you have to write here double brackets as well„ÄÇ

So if you now press control S and if you go backÔºå if you try to run your script„ÄÇ

 you would see it would give give the same resultÔºå Okay„ÄÇ

 so that is just a different syntax so you can also do something like this„ÄÇAnd like this„ÄÇ

It would work the same way„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so these are basically two different three different syntax for or statement as well„ÄÇ

 So if we go backÔºå if we try to run our scriptÔºå you can see that we have got the same results„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I hope you have got the point so till now we have learned regarding to the conditional topics we have learned if statements„ÄÇ

 if else statementsÔºå if else if statementsÔºå the and statements or or the and operator and the or operator as well„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so now moving on to the next point we are going to discuss case statement„ÄÇ

So case statement is not very different from the if statement„ÄÇ

 so you can call the case statements as multiple if statements as well„ÄÇ

 so if the same thing that you can do with the case statement you can also do it with the if else statement multiple if else statement as well okay so now let's go ahead„ÄÇ

 let's take an example of core so we'll write here case and we'll write here car which is a variable we write here core equals let's say dollar„ÄÇ

So the next topicÔºå you knowÔºå it's about loops„ÄÇ AlrightÔºå so in this topic„ÄÇ

 we would discuss while loopsÔºå we would discuss until loops„ÄÇ we would discuss four loops„ÄÇ

 and we would also discuss break and continue statements„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so let's go ahead and let's start„ÄÇ

 So well go back to our script„ÄÇ And you knowÔºå for nowÔºå let's just remove all of it„ÄÇ we don't need it„ÄÇ

 And right hereÔºå the while loop„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so we' would write here while„ÄÇAnd right hereÔºå we'll write„ÄÇ

Any conditionÔºå let's sayÔºå first of all let us declare a variableÔºå let's say a number„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇ

 let's call itÔºå you knowÔºå let's say one„ÄÇ And we write here a statement„ÄÇ Let's say number„ÄÇLet's say„ÄÇ

 less than„ÄÇOr equal to„ÄÇOr less than„ÄÇÁ≠â„ÄÇAnd in here„ÄÇWe I do„ÄÇ We write hereÔºå echo„ÄÇ

So the idea is that the syntax of the while loop is something like this while„ÄÇ

And then you write here conditionÔºå and then you write hereÔºå do„ÄÇ

 and then you write here all the statements that you're going to write„ÄÇ And then you write here done„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå at the end„ÄÇSo let me write here done OkayÔºå so inside of that inside of this right here between do and done„ÄÇ

 youd write all the statements that you want to execute„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now let's say we write here we want to execute and now we want to increment the n the number„ÄÇ

It's actually number hereÔºå rightÔºüSo we' write here number„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇThen we write here dollar sign„ÄÇ

 Then we write here„ÄÇDouble brackets or double parentheesis and„ÄÇWill increment„ÄÇAnd plus one„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now I'll explain to you what's happening here„ÄÇ So first of allÔºå we have a variable numberÔºå which„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå it has a value 1 and it one comes here„ÄÇ One is obviously less than 10„ÄÇ

 So it would go ahead and it would print it out one„ÄÇ and then it would basically add„ÄÇInside number„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå number plus one„ÄÇSo„ÄÇIt would one plus one„ÄÇ it would be2Ôºå so it would come back here„ÄÇ

 Now the number is2Ôºå so two is less than 10„ÄÇ it would come here againÔºå it would check„ÄÇ

 it would print it out here and then it would incremented again So now two plus one is3 so it comes back here now it checks again three is less than 10 and then it basically repeats the cycle okay so if we save it if we go back to our terminal and if we try to run our script hello script do sets you can see that it basically prints out the value still 9 10 it has not printed out because when it was 9„ÄÇ

9 was printed out then it has incremented it it incremented it like„ÄÇüéº9 plus1Ôºå10„ÄÇ It goes back here„ÄÇ

10 is not less than 10„ÄÇ OkayÔºå that is false„ÄÇ So basically it doesn't execute anything„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 and it comes out of the while loop automatically„ÄÇ So now if we do something like less than0 or equal to„ÄÇ

 So now this condition would be true because 10 could be equal to 10„ÄÇ Alright„ÄÇ

 so now you can see that it has basically printed out 10 as well„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so that was basically while loops„ÄÇ So you can basically you knowÔºå make it„ÄÇ

 you know as complicated as you can„ÄÇ But that was basically the simplest introduction of while loops„ÄÇ

 So now let's go ahead and let's try to do the same thing with the until loops„ÄÇ

 So until loops are almost the same for until loopÔºå we will just right here until„ÄÇ

And obviously we're right here„ÄÇ So until is it's basically that greater than or equal to„ÄÇ

 So until we'll run until this statement is you knowÔºå until it becomes trueÔºå okayÔºå so nowÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 when the oneÔºå one is greater than or equal to 10„ÄÇ obviously it is notÔºå it is false„ÄÇ

 So this loop will run until this condition is false„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I hope you've got the point in the while loop the while loop was running until this condition was true„ÄÇ

 okay„ÄÇBut until Luke will run until this condition becomes true„ÄÇAlright„ÄÇ

 so I hope you've got the point so now obviously we know that this until loop is going run until the value becomes 10 Okay„ÄÇ

 so then 10 is will be greater than or equal to 10 that condition would be true so it would break and it would come out of the loop okay so we save it and we go back here to our terminal and we try to run„ÄÇ

And we write here„ÄÇAnd you can see that until loop has run until loop has run„ÄÇ

 and it has printed out the values 1Ôºå2Ôºå3Ôºå4Ôºå5Ôºå6Ôºå7Ôºå8Ôºå9Ôºå till 9„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 it has not printed out 10 because when 10 came hereÔºå it basicallyÔºå you knowÔºå it became false„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so sorry it became true„ÄÇ and the until condition or the until loop became false and itÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 came out of the loop„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so I'm explaining to you again„ÄÇ

So the idea is that this number one here it comes here„ÄÇ

 so1 is greater than or equal to 10 this condition is false okay right so if you write here while this this loop will break right away okay because this condition is false so it will not print anything„ÄÇ

But in this caseÔºå this this condition is false and we have until loop here„ÄÇ

 so until loop will run until this condition would become true okay„ÄÇ

 so as long as the condition is falseÔºå the until loop will keep on running alright„ÄÇ

üéºSo I hope you have got the point„ÄÇ So moving on to the next loop which is like for loop„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so we have done while loop and we have done until loop„ÄÇ

 So now we'll focus on while we'll focus on for loop OkayÔºå so for loop„ÄÇ you know„ÄÇ

 basically we can write for loop in two fundamental ways in ba scripting„ÄÇ So I is basically„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå you can name the variable I and then you write here in and then you can write here 1Ôºå2Ôºå3„ÄÇ

4Ôºå5„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so then you write here2„ÄÇüéºAnd then you write here echo and then you print out basically I and done here„ÄÇ

 So basically I is gonna be printing out like 1Ôºå2Ôºå3Ôºå4Ôºå5„ÄÇ Okay so we go here„ÄÇ

 we clear it and we run our script and you can see that it has printed out1Ôºå2Ôºå3Ôºå4„ÄÇ

5 So you can say that you cannot write actually till hundred„ÄÇ Yes that's right„ÄÇ

 we cannot write that So for that we have an alternative we we but we would do that we write here 0 would go we put double dos here„ÄÇ

 we write here 10Ôºå let's say 20 So we save it and now if we run our script„ÄÇ

 let me just clear it first if we run our script„ÄÇNow you can see that basically it has printed out from 0 to 20„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå all of that„ÄÇ So now we can actually make a change here as well„ÄÇ So if we do that„ÄÇ

 basically what it means that the first one is basically starting point„ÄÇ

 Then we have the ending point„ÄÇEndingÔºå and then we have the incriement„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now it would print out all of that with the increment of twos„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so for like0„ÄÇ

 then it would print out„ÄÇ2Ôºå and then so on and so forth„ÄÇ So let's save it„ÄÇLet me actually delete„ÄÇ

That because it would give the error because it isn't a comment as well„ÄÇ

 So we save it and we go back hereÔºå we clear it„ÄÇ we try to run our script and you can see that it has basically printed out everything with the increment of2 okay so I hope you've got the point So that is basically one way of writing for loop theres there is another way of writing for loop which is conventional across you know all programming languages this is a very famous way of writing for loop So you you do something like this„ÄÇ

 you put on double brackets and then you write the variable name you initialize it with zero and then you write here I„ÄÇ

 then you write here a condition let's say5„ÄÇüéºAnd then you basically increment it„ÄÇ OkayÔºå I plus plus„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå then basically you itÔºå it stays the same echo I and then done„ÄÇ obviouslyÔºå what it would do„ÄÇ

 it would print out from 0 to 4„ÄÇ OkayÔºå ifÔºå if the condition would have been I less than equal to 5„ÄÇ

 then it would have printed out 5 as well„ÄÇ So now let's save it„ÄÇ

 Let's go ahead and let's see what happens„ÄÇSo now you can see that it has printed out from  zero to4 okay„ÄÇ

 so that was basically a while loop until loop and4 loop„ÄÇ

Now let's move on and let's discuss the break and continue statement„ÄÇ

 so let's let's use this same example so we write here let's say I is less than equal to let's say 10 okay so then we add a condition here„ÄÇ

 let's say we write here f„ÄÇAnd then we write hereÔºå you know„ÄÇDollar I„ÄÇAnd then obviously„ÄÇ

 we write here greater then„ÄÇAnd then let's say 5„ÄÇ OkayÔºå and then we write here then„ÄÇ

 and then we write here„ÄÇBak„ÄÇLike thisÔºå okay„ÄÇAnd then we write here F5„ÄÇ

 which basically close you the if statement„ÄÇ So what's going to happen is that it is going first of all„ÄÇ

 the fall loop is going to be executed„ÄÇ OkayÔºå and then inside the for loopÔºå there is an if statement„ÄÇ

 So this if statement is going to check that if I is greater than5 or not„ÄÇ okay„ÄÇ

 so obviously I first of allÔºå I is going to be0 so that condition is false So it would basically not execute it would not execute this block„ÄÇ

 it would just go ahead and it would execute this one here„ÄÇ then it would come back„ÄÇ

 it would increment it and it would start to increment it until it reaches5„ÄÇ

Okay so what would happenÔºå this condition would become false„ÄÇ5 is not greater than 5„ÄÇ

5 is equal to 5 right finallyÔºå when this I would become6Ôºå it would come hereÔºå6 is greater than 5„ÄÇ

 yesÔºå this if condition is now true„ÄÇ So it would execute this one So it would basically break it would execute the brake statement„ÄÇ

 So what this brake statement would do that it would break this loop„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 and it would come out of the loop„ÄÇ So the loop increment would stop and the loop execution would stop and the program would come out of the fall loop„ÄÇ

 it would break the fall loop OkayÔºå so I hope you've got the point„ÄÇ

 So now let's go ahead and let's save it and let's try to run our program or our script So we right here you know hello script and we hit enter you can see that it has printed out till5 but as soon as it has I has become6 it has basically you know„ÄÇ

This condition is trueÔºå and the brake statement was was executed„ÄÇ

 and it has broken out of the follow„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so I hope you have got the point„ÄÇ

 So now let's discuss the continuous statementÔºå so„ÄÇLet's go ahead and let's try to write here if„ÄÇ

 and then we would write here IÔºå and then we would write here E QÔºå and then we' would write here3„ÄÇ

And thenÔºå let's say„ÄÇWe write here„ÄÇ double pipe sign„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇAnd then let's say we right hereÔºå you know„ÄÇ

Dollar I„ÄÇThenÔºå we write here„ÄÇEqual„ÄÇLe say7„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇSo then we write here then„ÄÇ

 and then we write here inside of that conum„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇSo now we save it„ÄÇ

 So what's going happen is that it is going to print out everythingÔºå but it is going to skip 3 and 7„ÄÇ

 So basically when the condition is going become trueÔºå either one of them„ÄÇ

 this thing is going to execute„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so let's say when the I value is become3„ÄÇ

 this condition was true„ÄÇ So the continue was executed„ÄÇ

 So continue basically takes you out of the loop„ÄÇ OkayÔºå it doesn't execute whatever isÔºå you know„ÄÇ

Whatever is hereÔºå it takes you out and then it comes back and it starts to this„ÄÇ

 execute the loop again„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so the brake statementÔºå it comes out and it basically breaks the loop„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå it goes here and it goes back okay so you can say that basically continue thing it goes back from here okay„ÄÇ

 the brake statement it comes here first and then it stays here„ÄÇ

 okay the continuous statement it basically goes back right here„ÄÇ Alright„ÄÇ

 okay so when the I's value would become threeÔºå obviously this would be true„ÄÇ

 and it would execute the continuous statement„ÄÇ So what continuous statement does„ÄÇ

 it doesn't go aheadÔºå it goes back here„ÄÇ So the brake statement was actually breaking the loop and going out of the loop but the continuous statement„ÄÇ

 it goes back here okay so when the value would become3„ÄÇ

 it would go back here and similarly when the value would become7Ôºå it would go back„ÄÇHere again„ÄÇ

 okay after executing the continuous statement„ÄÇ So for all other valuesÔºå for exampleÔºå for0Ôºå1Ôºå24Ôºå5„ÄÇ

6 and 8Ôºå9Ôºå10Ôºå it would be false the if conditionÔºå So it would not execute the continuous statement So it would echo all of them Okay so I hope you've got the point„ÄÇ

 so we'll go ahead and we press control as we save it so now let's try to run our script„ÄÇ

 so you can see that it has basically printed out from 0 to 10 except3 and 7„ÄÇ

 Okay so I hope you've got the point about break and continue statement„ÄÇ

 you have understand while loop for loops and until loop as well So now let's move ahead to the next topic Okay so the next topic is script input So inside this topic would see that how how do we deal with dollar $1 $23 the inputs that we give to the script„ÄÇ

Also discuss about the dollar hash and dollar at and we'll also see that how we can give an input as a file and how we can read that file using STDIN Okay„ÄÇ

 so let's start with this topic so we'll go back to our script„ÄÇ

And what we would do is that we just simply write here echo and then we' would write here  dollar 1 23„ÄÇ

 let's say„ÄÇ So what this program or what this script would do that when we would run our script„ÄÇ

 what would happen is that lets let me just go to desktop firstÔºå Okay„ÄÇ

 because desktop is the place where our script resides so„ÄÇ

What we are going to do is that we're going to run our script and the first argument that we are going to give here„ÄÇ

 let's say we give the card company names„ÄÇ So we would right here PMMW Mercedes„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_9.png)

ÈÉΩÊúâ‰∫Ü„ÄÇOkayÔºå so right now this thing represents this input represents dollar one„ÄÇ

 this input represents dollar2Ôºå and this input represents dollar„ÄÇ3Ôºå okay„ÄÇ

 so now if we would hit enterÔºå you can see that we have got these three things on the output„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so we have given these three things as input and inside the scriptÔºå we have printed them out„ÄÇ

 So obviously we have them on output„ÄÇ So what if you just do a little addition here like let's say dollar0„ÄÇ

 So what would happen is that now this file nameÔºå this script name will also be printed out because we are giving it as on on the zeroth argument„ÄÇ

 So let's go aheadÔºå let's try to run our script and let's say we type the car names again now let's try to change it on„ÄÇ

Toyota„ÄÇ so we hit enter and you can see that because of dollar 0Ôºå the0 argument„ÄÇ

 the script name has been printed out„ÄÇ and for because of dollar1Ôºå the BMW has been printed out„ÄÇ

 And because of the dollar 2Ôºå Honda has been printed out„ÄÇ And because of dollar 3„ÄÇ

 Toyota has been printed out„ÄÇ So there is another thing that you could do„ÄÇ

 And that is basically that you can take all the arguments in the form of an array„ÄÇ

 And then you can actually print them out„ÄÇ So let's say„ÄÇWe go here and just remove this„ÄÇ

 So now what we would doÔºå we would create an array„ÄÇ and obviously„ÄÇ

 we do not know that how many number of inputs are gonna be there„ÄÇ So what we're going do„ÄÇ

 which we will just right here at„ÄÇAnd before a would write here dollar sign„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so this represents the unlimited number of like inputs„ÄÇ so you can type in like 15 inputs„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 that's no problem„ÄÇ But if we would specify like three hereÔºå then we can only give three inputs„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so we don't want that„ÄÇ we are trying to get array and we would we would take unlimited inputs„ÄÇ

 So what we would do nowÔºå we would print out the each and every index of the array„ÄÇ

 So now what we would do would write here echo dollar sign„ÄÇ And then inside of that„ÄÇ

 the name of the arrayÔºå which is A Gs„ÄÇ And then the index number„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now we would simply copy and paste this thing from here„ÄÇThere's still this„ÄÇ OkayÔºå0„ÄÇWen„ÄÇ

And let's sayÔºå let's do it too„ÄÇ So let's see if it works out„ÄÇ So now we would go here„ÄÇ

 we try to run our script again„ÄÇLet me clear it„ÄÇ So would right here„ÄÇHelloÔºå script taught S„ÄÇ

 and then we'd give the arguments„ÄÇ Let's say we gave three inputsÔºå BMW„ÄÇÂóØHowÁöÑ„ÄÇüéºMercedes„ÄÇ

So now if we hit enterÔºå you can see that we have got three outputs„ÄÇ OkayÔºå BMW Honda Mercedes„ÄÇ

 So now what has happened is that in the arrayÔºå this BMW which was like taller one here„ÄÇ

 now it has been assigned zeroth index in the array as if you' are familiar with the programming„ÄÇ

 we are going to discuss arraysÔºå you know ahead„ÄÇ So if you don't know about arrays„ÄÇ

 don't worry because it's coming„ÄÇ So the idea is for now just remember that the arrays always start from zeroth index„ÄÇ

 Okay so the first value that you're gonna give to the array„ÄÇ

 it's going to be stored inside the zeroth index of array„ÄÇ

 So right now you can see that the zeroth index of the array has this first value okay and the second value that we are giving the input it's been you know assigned to the first index„ÄÇ

 the one index which is actually the second index„ÄÇTheÔºå okay„ÄÇThen the index number two„ÄÇ

 which is actually the third index„ÄÇ it contains the value Mercedes„ÄÇ

 the third input that we are giving„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so I hope you've got the point„ÄÇ

 So if you want to print outÔºå you knowÔºå all the arrayÔºå there is another way to do that„ÄÇ

 And that is basically now I have commented this line„ÄÇ So it has no effect„ÄÇ

 it has no impact on the script„ÄÇSo if you want to print out likeÔºå you knowÔºå all the array like„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå how manyÔºå no matter how many inputs you giveÔºå they are all gonna be printed out„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now if we save thisÔºå if we go back hereÔºå we write here hellello script„ÄÇ

 then we write here BMW Honda Mer let's type Toyota as an additionÔºå if we hit enter„ÄÇ

 you can see that all four inputs have been printed out because the array was there„ÄÇ

 so array has taken all four inputs and then because of this at dollar at the rate of because of this it has printed out all the values that it has taken okay„ÄÇ

So I hope you have got the point„ÄÇ So if you want to know that how many indexes are there so in order to do that in order to measure the length of the array we have echo and dollar and the hash sign Okay so if you right here something like this dollar hash and if you echo it then what it would do that it would print out the length of the array So if we do something like this hello and then we would write your BMW and Toyota if we hit enter you can see that it has basically printed out the length of the array which is essentially3 allright so that was the arguments that we have played with so that was all about input so what we can do is that we can also read the file as well using STDN so let's try to do that let's write that code so first of all„ÄÇ

rite a while loop because we are going to read the file line by line„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I'm going show you that if you don't select any file„ÄÇ

 then it the program would would actually just work you know in in a complete different way„ÄÇ

 So it would create a shellÔºå it would assume the shell as a file and whatever you would write it would simply print that out okay„ÄÇ

So now we write here while and then we write here read and then we write here line and we write here do and then we write here echo and then we are just going to print out„ÄÇ

LineÔºå okay„ÄÇAnd then basically we're going to close the while loop„ÄÇBut here were gonna do an addition„ÄÇ

 so we are just going to write here something like this Do one dollar one would be basically it would basically the it would basically be the input that we are that we would give as the file name okay so dollar one and then we write here something like this and then we give the path of the STDN because we are using STDN to read the file Okay so that's it So now if we save it and we go ahead and we try to run our script so let me just square it so first of all„ÄÇ

 let's say if we don't give any file like right now dollar one would be the first argument here but let's say we don't give any file name okay if we hit enter so now you can see that it has basically created the terminal as a file So whatever I would write here this is a file if I hit enter„ÄÇ

 you can see that it has basically printed that out So now„ÄÇWhat no matter what I would write„ÄÇ

 it would basically print that out Okay because I have not given an argument and because of STDI and it has assumed that the terminal is a file Okay„ÄÇ

 so it would take the input and then it would print out the output assuming that it's coming from the file„ÄÇ

 but that's not the case so„ÄÇPres control Z break that and come out and now wed give the argument so let's say I have this file on desktoptop untitled document one which has all the topics„ÄÇ

 so let's try to give the name of this file now as as an argument So dollar one so would' write here untitled document one and these slashes are here because we want it to assume one file okay so because of these spaces inside it would assume them as three files three argument but we just want all these three words to be assumed as a single argument okay so now if we hit enter you can see that it has basically read the file and after reading the file it has basically printed all the stuff out okay so that's how you basically read the file using STD and IN okay so now let's move on to the next topic„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so the next topic that we are going discuss is script output„ÄÇ So in the script output„ÄÇ

 like we are gonna discuss the standard output and the standard error„ÄÇ OkayÔºå these two things„ÄÇ

 So in the previous topicÔºå we have discussed standard input„ÄÇ alright„ÄÇ

 so the idea is that the standard output is something like thisÔºå let me show you Ls negative ill„ÄÇ

 if we do thatÔºå if we do thatÔºå So this is basically our standard output„ÄÇ

 So what if we want to redirect this standard output to a fileÔºå of course we can do it„ÄÇ

 and I'll show you in a while„ÄÇ So let's say the standard error„ÄÇ So if we do something like this„ÄÇ

 Ls plus L„ÄÇ So this is basically the standard error„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so„ÄÇ

What's going to happen is that we are going to write a script in which we are basically just going to redirect the standard output and the standard error to two fundamental basic files so we can do that in the same file as well I'll also show you that so we're going write here Ls negative a and then we're gonna write here1 and then we're gonna write here the file name„ÄÇ

 let's say file 1 do pxt and then we write here2 and then we write here file2 do Tt So basically this one represents the standard output and it will send the standard output to the file1 dot text and similarly this two represents the standard error and it will send the error to the file to dot text So right now we know that the command is right so they would be standard output and there would be no standard error so it would send the standard output in this file and this file would be„ÄÇ

CreatedÔºå but of courseÔºå there would be no standard error„ÄÇ So this file would be emptyy„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so we save it„ÄÇ but go ahead and we try to run our script„ÄÇ

 So we hit enter and you can see that two files have been created„ÄÇ So if we if we go to file one„ÄÇ

 you can see that this is our standard output that we have redirected to the file successfully„ÄÇ

 And if we go to this file toÔºå you can see that it's emy because there is no error„ÄÇ

 but our standard error will be redirected to here„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so„ÄÇLet's try to make a mistake„ÄÇ

 Let's try to create the standard error„ÄÇ So now let's see what happens„ÄÇ

 So if we go here and if we run the script now if we come back to file one„ÄÇ

 if we if we reload you can see that there is nothing okay so if we go to file2 if we reload you can see that there is the standard error okay so standard output file is emy standard error file has something in it which is an error essentially okay so I hope you've got the point you can also basically transfer the standard output to one file so basically let's say if we delete these two files„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_11.png)

And let's say that if we just write something like thisÔºå if we do not specify anything like you know„ÄÇ

 if we just write something like thisÔºå so what's going to happen that this is going to automatically assume that this file is the standard output file okay„ÄÇ

 so if we save this and if we try to run our script like something like this„ÄÇ

You can see that it has created the file one and it has the standard output inside of it„ÄÇ

 so now let's try to do the error and let's see if it assume it as a standard error file as well so we go ahead„ÄÇ

And we do something like this„ÄÇ and you can see that it has basically not created this file as the standard error file„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå rather what it has done that it has given the errorÔºå the standard error on the terminal„ÄÇÂèóÂïä„ÄÇ

You can also create one file for the standard output and standard error as well„ÄÇ

 So the way to do that is something like this„ÄÇ So you would write2 and then you would write this and person sign and then one okay so now basically this file will be used for both okay standard output and standard input„ÄÇ

 So now the command is correct„ÄÇ So if we run the strip so and if we go to file one you can see that„ÄÇ

ReloadÔºå we have this standard output hereÔºå but if we now„ÄÇ

 if we try to go to our script and if we make an error hereÔºå let's say something like this„ÄÇ

Now if we run our script„ÄÇAnd if we go back to file1 dot text„ÄÇ

 says reload and now you can see that it has basically displayed the standard error in the same file„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so there is a shortcut to do that like you know let's say if you don't want to write this thing right here so what you can do is that you can also just right here am person sign„ÄÇ

And it will do the work„ÄÇ So now basically what has happened that it would redirect the standard output and standard error to the same file as well„ÄÇ

 So basically that is just simply a shortcut okay so now let's go ahead and let's try to run our script and you can see and if we go to51 dot text you can see that we have the standard output if we try to make a mistake„ÄÇ

We do plus„ÄÇ And if we try to run our script again„ÄÇNow you can see again in the file one„ÄÇ

 we have got the standard error„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so the next topic that we're going discuss is pipes„ÄÇ

 So I put pipes here because so what we are going do that we're not gonna discuss pipes„ÄÇ

 but we're going to teach you„ÄÇ Let's name it as send output„ÄÇFrom one script to anotherÔºå okay„ÄÇ

From one script„ÄÇDo another„ÄÇOkayÔºå to another script„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

So basically I have figured out an easy way to do it„ÄÇ So with pipes„ÄÇ

 basically you transfer your one command output to another command„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so but if you want to transfer your whole script to another script there is a simpler way that I have figured it out„ÄÇ

 So let's go ahead and let's try to do it„ÄÇ So we go to our script let me close that so in here„ÄÇ

 we are going to writeÔºå let's say this is our first script„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so this is hello script dot S and inside of that we write something like let's say message we create a variable and then we write here hello„ÄÇ

Linux hand audience„ÄÇOkayÔºå so now„ÄÇWhat I do that I basically export this message to another script that I'm going to create„ÄÇ

 I have not created that script yetÔºå but I'll create thatÔºå so„ÄÇII'll name it as let's say„ÄÇ

 second scriptÔºå OkayÔºå not as such„ÄÇSo now what would happen is that basically this message variable„ÄÇ

 it contains hello Linux and audienceÔºå and I would export it to the second scriptÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 which I would„ÄÇCreateÔºå so now I would go here„ÄÇ Let me just create a text file„ÄÇQuickly„ÄÇ

 I'll basically write here slash„ÄÇSlash binÔºå slash bash„ÄÇAnd I would save it as a dot S file„ÄÇ

So I would basically name it„ÄÇSecond„ÄÇscriptcr„ÄÇ

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_13.png)

üéºDot S„ÄÇ So now basically I have created the bash file„ÄÇ

 but there's one problem that it is not executecutable„ÄÇ If we go here do something like this„ÄÇ

 you can see that this second script dot S is not executable So what we've got to do we have to make it executeable as we as we have made this hello script dot S executeecutable So what we're gonna do we're going to write hereHM mod and then we're going write here plus X which would add executable executable permissions Ex me„ÄÇ

And then we're gonna write here the file nameÔºå which is essentially second script„ÄÇ

 because that's where we want to make changesÔºå rightÔºå So nowÔºå if we clear it„ÄÇ

 if we let say negative A LÔºå you can see that it has turned green„ÄÇ

 So it means that it is now executable„ÄÇ So now inside of thatÔºå basically I haveÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 I have exported the variable message to this script„ÄÇ So now inside of that„ÄÇ

 I'm just gonna echo I'm gonna write here the message„ÄÇFrom hello strip„ÄÇLet let me just write here„ÄÇ

 hello„ÄÇScrt„ÄÇIs„ÄÇAnd then basically I write here the variable nameÔºå which is essentially message„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now I save that both of these scripts have been saved„ÄÇ

So now if I go ahead and you can see that in this script„ÄÇ

 there is no no such thing as the you know echo message„ÄÇ the echo message is here„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now what I'm going do I'm going run this hello script Okay„ÄÇ

 and let's see what happens So I run this hello strip and you can see that it says the message from hello script is and then hello Linux audience so basically what is happening that we are sending this from one script to another„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so that's how you basically do it alright„ÄÇSo I hope you' got the So now let's go ahead and let's try to do a few things„ÄÇ

 So in string processingÔºå let's do something like let's compare the strings and let's see if we can do it and then let's say let's see if we can actually compare if they are equal and if they are less or if they are more like greater than each other or smaller than each other„ÄÇ

 So let's try that and then well concatenate and then we can actually convert it to to the upper case in the lower case„ÄÇ

 yeahÔºå things like that„ÄÇ So let's go ahead and let's try to do it okay so„ÄÇüéºFirst of all„ÄÇ

 what I'm going to doÔºå I'm going actually take the input from the user„ÄÇ Like obviously„ÄÇ

 I would give the input so we could do something like this„ÄÇ enter first string„ÄÇ

 and then we can actually read itÔºå read„ÄÇS D1„ÄÇAnd then we could actuallyÔºå yes„ÄÇ

 we could actually do something like enter„ÄÇüéºSecond string„ÄÇ

 And then we could actually name it as read S T 2„ÄÇAnd then we can actually write here the if condition„ÄÇ

Which would actually do whatÔºå which would actually compare„ÄÇThe stringÔºå S D1„ÄÇWith S T2„ÄÇ

 So if the string is like the sameÔºå then in that case„ÄÇ

 it is actually going to print out something like this„ÄÇ So we right here then„ÄÇEcho stringsÔºå match„ÄÇ

 or both strings„ÄÇ‰π∞„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇIn factÔºå I think that is enough strings match„ÄÇAnd then we write here else„ÄÇ

We write hereÔºå E„ÄÇAnd then we write hereÔºå strings„ÄÇ Don't match„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇSo we write here F I„ÄÇ

 which basically ends the if statementÔºå rightÔºå So now let's go ahead„ÄÇ

 let's save it and let's try to run our script by going back to the terminal„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 we don't have terminal„ÄÇ So control all D„ÄÇüéºAnd obviously„ÄÇ

 we go to our text stop where our script resides„ÄÇ and then we try to run our script„ÄÇ

It says enter first string„ÄÇ So let's say I enter Linux hand„ÄÇ and it says second string„ÄÇ

 Let's say I enter something else like ABC„ÄÇYou can see that it says strings don't matchÔºå right„ÄÇ

 because it has tried to compare it„ÄÇ AndÔºå you knowÔºå they didn't match„ÄÇ

 So now let's try to do something like this again„ÄÇ Let's try to run our script again„ÄÇüéºHelloÔºå yes„ÄÇ

 And then let's put in Linux hand again„ÄÇ Linux hand„ÄÇ

 So now you can see that it says string strings match„ÄÇ

 So now in order to make sure that basically it isn't comparing the lens„ÄÇ So what we can do„ÄÇ

 we can write here„ÄÇ ABC„ÄÇ And then let's do it like AB„ÄÇ OkayÔºå now the length is same„ÄÇ

 Now let's see it you can see that it says strings don't match„ÄÇ

 So it means that it is not actually matching the length„ÄÇ

 it is actually matching the actual order of the stringsÔºå okay„ÄÇ

So the next thing that we can do is that we can actually check if the string is smaller„ÄÇ

Then the other stringÔºå like ifÔºå if we have written down hereÔºå stringÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 Linux hint and we have written here ABCÔºå then obviously string false string isÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 it's greater„ÄÇ So let's see how we can check that„ÄÇSo„ÄÇThat was basically the comparison for that„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 let's try to write down„ÄÇA complete new condition„ÄÇ So right here„ÄÇÂïä„ÄÇSomething like this„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and then we' write here thenÔºå obviously„ÄÇAnd then we'll write hereÔºå echo„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇ

Obviously you can see here the sign shows that the a string is smaller„ÄÇ

 right that condition is going to be true when the string1„ÄÇ

 the first string is going to be smaller than the string2„ÄÇ So we would right here„ÄÇ

That taller S D 1 is smaller than„ÄÇOr S1 is smaller than dollar„ÄÇS T2Ôºå okay„ÄÇ

And then we're going write here else if„ÄÇOkayÔºå and inside the elsevesÔºå F„ÄÇ

 we are just going to reverse the order„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so let me just„ÄÇCopy this from hereÔºå the condition„ÄÇ

And then we come back hereÔºå we paste itÔºå and we just reverse the angle bracketÔºå okay„ÄÇ

And then we write hereÔºå echo„ÄÇWe write hereÔºå S D„ÄÇ2 is smaller„ÄÇThen„ÄÇSG„ÄÇ1Ôºå okayÔºå so you can write here„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå S1 is greater than S2Ôºå you knowÔºå whatever you wantÔºå it it is personal preference„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I just have written here S2 is smaller„ÄÇ So now we write L statement if none of them happens then it means that the strings are equal Okay„ÄÇ

 so just right here both strings are equal„ÄÇLike this we forgot to write here then„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so don't make these small mistakes„ÄÇ So we clear it and then we try to run our script„ÄÇ

 So we'll write here Linux hand„ÄÇAnd then we write here A S with hit enter„ÄÇ

 You can see that it says AS is smaller than Linux hint„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now we come here and we try to run our program again„ÄÇ

 So now let's say if I write here Linux hint and then I write here LI N„ÄÇ

 you can see that it says LIN is smaller than Linux hint„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so now we do the opposite„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so we let's say we write hereÔºå you knowÔºå ABCÔºå and then in the second string„ÄÇ

 let's say we write here let's say againÔºå Linux hand„ÄÇ

So you can see that it says ABC is smaller than Linux hand„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so I hope you've got the idea„ÄÇ

 So now if we enter the same stringÔºå like let's say ABCÔºå ABC„ÄÇ

 you can see that it says both strings are equal OkayÔºå so now when we come to the concatenation„ÄÇ

 we can also do that„ÄÇ So we just remove it and in here„ÄÇ

What we're going to do if we want to concatenateÔºå so we' write here C„ÄÇ

 which would be another variableÔºå then we would basically write here ST1„ÄÇAnd then S2Ôºå okay„ÄÇ

 with a dollar sign„ÄÇ and then we want to print out„ÄÇ

The concatetnation we just tried here echo dollar C Okay„ÄÇ

 so now let's go ahead and let's try to run our script So the first string„ÄÇ

 let's say a Linux hint and then the enter second string let's say hello„ÄÇSo if we hint and hit enter„ÄÇ

 you can see that it says Linux ando hello„ÄÇ So basicallyÔºå it has„ÄÇConcatenated these two strings„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so I hope you have got the point„ÄÇ So now let's try to turn them into the uppercase and lower case„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so let's see let's say that if we get the input have from S1„ÄÇ

 as let's say in smaller letters then what's gonna what what we're gonna do is something like this„ÄÇ

That we're going to write here the dollar signÔºå and then we're going to write here S1„ÄÇ

 and then we are just going to write here something like this„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 and then we're going to write here twice„ÄÇO„ÄÇFor upper case„ÄÇ AlrightÔºå so let's try to do this„ÄÇ

 Let's do S1 as a lower case and S2 as uppercase„ÄÇ Or let me just do that once„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 for S1 in both cases„ÄÇ So okayÔºå control S„ÄÇ And now we come back here„ÄÇ we try to run our script„ÄÇ

 So we give a value hereÔºå let's say an extent„ÄÇAnd let's say a we hit enter and you can see that basically it has printed out S1 in the lower case first„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå and then it has printed out S1 in the upper case because of these two signs okay so I hope you've got the point if you want to turn the first letter into capital so what you've got to do is that you have to actually mention the letter let's say we are going to enter Linuxcent so we'll mention the letter L here and now if we save it and if we go back if we try to run our program„ÄÇ

Or if we try to run our scriptÔºå we're going to write hereÔºå let's say Linux in„ÄÇ

 it send small so you can see that it has basically it has capitalized the first letter which is L okay so I hope you have got the point so now we'll move on to the next topic„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so the next topic that we are going to discuss is numbers and arithmatics Okay„ÄÇ

 so in this topic what we are going to do that were going to show you that how you can perform different arithmetic operations and we're also going to show you that how you can actually convert hex decimal number to a decimal number„ÄÇ

And let'sÔºå let's see how we can do itÔºå how we can actually add different numbers and how we can do it„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so let's go ahead and let me just clear it first„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so let's go ahead and let's try to write code here„ÄÇ So if I do something like this„ÄÇ

 if I do like echo 21 or 31 plus 21„ÄÇ if I save it„ÄÇ And if I go back here and if I try to run my script you can see that it has printed out 31 plus 21„ÄÇ

 it has not basically added both of these values„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so in order to add them there is a different there are two fundamental techniques that you can perform in order to add them„ÄÇ

 So first of allÔºå let's say we create two variables like n1 is equal to 4 and we create n2 is equal to 20„ÄÇ

 let's say okayÔºå so now let's say if we want to add them we have to do something like this„ÄÇ

Echo and then we write here dollar sign and then we write double parentheesis„ÄÇ

 then we give a space and then we write here n1 plus and2 okay„ÄÇ

 and if we save it and if we try to run our script now„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

You can see that it has given a result 24„ÄÇ It has basically added these two valuesÔºå right„ÄÇ

So what we can do here is that we can perform the arithtic operations„ÄÇ

 all sorts of arithmatic operations in this way„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so divisionÔºå okay„ÄÇüéºWe can subtract it„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 we can actually multiply it„ÄÇ We can divide it„ÄÇ and actuallyÔºå we can have„ÄÇThe remainder of it„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so we save it„ÄÇ We go ahead and we try to run our script„ÄÇSo„ÄÇIf we„ÄÇ

If we run our script so now you can see that here we have the output 24 minus-16 a0 and 4„ÄÇ

 so if we divide it so the answer goes into something like you know zero point something okay so basically it is not showing the output in the floats it is showing in the integer rather okay so that's why it's0 and you can see that it has basically subtracted it„ÄÇ

 it has added itÔºå it has multiplied it as well and it has given you the remainder as well okay so there is another way to perform the same operations and that way is something like this„ÄÇ

 let me show you that as well„ÄÇSo you can basically use EXPR„ÄÇSo you can use EXPR expression as well„ÄÇ

 So what you can doÔºå you can write here EXPR and then you can remove this one parentheesis and you're good to go„ÄÇ

 but you just have to write here the dollar sign„ÄÇTo actually„ÄÇCreate it as a different variable„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so dollar n1 is not and N2 are not actually considered by this dollar sign now because it is been it is now associated with A XPR„ÄÇ

 So now„ÄÇAfter writing E XPRÔºå you have to write daughter sign here and here as well„ÄÇ

Let me just write here„ÄÇ So now if we save it and if we go backÔºå if we try to run our script„ÄÇ

 you can see that it gives us the same result„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now we'd perform the same functions for you know like„ÄÇSubtraction„ÄÇ

Mulipplication and division and remainder„ÄÇWe write here multiplication„ÄÇ

 and then we write here divisionÔºå and then we' write here the remainderÔºå okayÔºå we control S„ÄÇ

 we save it and we go backÔºå we try to run our script„ÄÇ

Here you can see that it says expression syn text error and it has given error because EXPR doesn't recognize the static sign„ÄÇ

 so we have to add a slash for it in order to recognize it so it right here slash hello script Now you can see that it has given the same results added as it was given with the previous method okay„ÄÇ

So these were the arithmetic operations that we have performed„ÄÇ

 We have seen that how we can add variablesÔºå we can how we can actually subtract multiply„ÄÇ

 divide and how we can have the remainder as well„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now basically we will convert the hexa decimal number to a decimal number okay„ÄÇ

So what we can do is that we can take the X number as an inputÔºå okay from the user„ÄÇ

 so we would right here echo„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇüéºHeggs number„ÄÇüéºOf your choice„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so once you have done that„ÄÇ

 So now what you got to doÔºå you have to read the heggs number„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so you right here hes„ÄÇ

And then you move forwardÔºå then you echo here like echoÔºå and then you write here the decimal value„ÄÇ

The decimal value„ÄÇOf hacks„ÄÇWhich is a variable hereÔºå rightÔºå Hes is„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and then we come to the next line and we echo it okay we now we are going to use basically O base and i base with the BC calculator okay„ÄÇ

 which is in bash so we're going to write here O base equals 10„ÄÇ

 which is for decimal number and then we're going to write here i base equals 16„ÄÇ

 which is for hex or decimal number okayÔºå which is for hes number„ÄÇ

üéºAnd then we are basically going to write hereÔºå heggs„ÄÇOkayÔºå the very„ÄÇ

And then we're going to write here5„ÄÇ and then we're going to write here Bc because we want it to be the B calculator„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so basicallyÔºå B calculator is being used to perform this current version„ÄÇ And certainly„ÄÇ

 there are other waysÔºå but I find it the easiest„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so now we control the asset„ÄÇ We go„ÄÇ

So now we are going to run our script and if we run our script it says enter hes number of your choice we write here FffffFF and you can see that basically it has converted the hex value to the decimal value the decimal value of FffF is 65535 okay so that's how basically you convert the hex number into the decimal number okay so the next topic is declare command okay so the idea is that the bash it doesn't have a strong type system Okay so you cannot actually restrict the variables in in bash„ÄÇ

 howeverÔºå to allow typelike behavior it uses attributes that can set by a command and that command is essentially called as declare okay so declare is a bash built in command that allows you to update attributes applied to variables within the scope of your shell„ÄÇ

AlrightSo in additionÔºå it can be used to declare a variable in longhand and it allows you to peek into the variables as well„ÄÇ

 So now let's see how we can actually work with it„ÄÇ

 So if if we actually talk about the terminal so let me just go to the texto first okay so if I write here declare negative P it will show me all kinds of variables that are present here okay in inside the shell„ÄÇ

 it will show all variables of the system So the idea is that you can actually you know create your own variables using declare commands and first of all we're going to try it out in the shell and in the terminal essentially and then we're going write down a script and we're going to declare a variables using this declare command inside the script okay so if I do something like this declare space negative P if„ÄÇ

Press enter„ÄÇ You can see that there are all sorts of variables here„ÄÇ

 So now if I do something like this declareÔºå let's say my variable„ÄÇ

And if I hit enter and if I do something like thisÔºå declare negative P„ÄÇ

 then you can see that it has basically created a variable name as declare„ÄÇMy variableÔºå okay„ÄÇSo„ÄÇ

What else I can doÔºå I can give this variable a value as well„ÄÇ So if I do something like this„ÄÇ

 declare„ÄÇMy variable„ÄÇEquals let's sayÔºå 22„ÄÇ So if I hit enter and if I go back and if I try to run„ÄÇ

 let me just clear it first quickly„ÄÇ And if I write hereÔºå declare negative P„ÄÇ

Then you can see that basically my variable has now the value 22„ÄÇ so now let's try to change it„ÄÇ

So if we write here declare and then we write here my variable„ÄÇEqualsÔºå and thenÔºå let's say 11„ÄÇ

We hit enter„ÄÇAnd now let's try to check if it has changed„ÄÇSo„ÄÇYou can see the variable„ÄÇ

 the value has changed„ÄÇBut we can also create read only variables as well„ÄÇ

 so this variable was not read onlyÔºå so it was not restricted„ÄÇ

 but we can create read only variables as well So how how would we do that So for that let's go ahead and let's create a script and let's write here code and let's see if we can declare a variable which we can restrict okay so negative R is for read only so it right here„ÄÇ

 let's say PwD file password fileÔºå let's say we put in the path of the password file in this variable„ÄÇ

Let's sayÔºå PW D file„ÄÇOrÔºå I think„ÄÇBsswordÔºå yes„ÄÇOkayÔºå so„ÄÇ

üéºThen we come to the next line and then we basically simply echo it okay„ÄÇ

 we echo the variable PwD fileÔºå we come to the next line and in here we try to make a change let's say first of all let me save it and let's go ahead and let's try to run it and let's see what happens so if we hit enter you can see that slash ETC slash password has been printed out because of this Okay so now let's try to change it Okay so we right here declare„ÄÇ

üéºOr not declare just we write here PWD file and then we write here equals„ÄÇ

 and then we write here slash EDC„ÄÇSlash let's say we create a text file ABc dot textÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 So if we save itÔºå if we go backÔºå if we try to run our script again„ÄÇ

You can see that it says PwD file is a read only variableÔºå so if we echo here again„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_15.png)

You can see„ÄÇThat„ÄÇLet me save it„ÄÇ We run our strip„ÄÇYou can see that basically it is printing out twice slash uTC slash password slash ETc slash password„ÄÇ

 So why is that Because the Pw D fileÔºå this variable is we have declared it as a read variable read only okay„ÄÇ

 so now we try to change it here but but it doesn't changeÔºå it gives us an error„ÄÇ

 and then when we print it out again it again prints out this value„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so this value has not changed„ÄÇ AllrightÔºå so I hope you have got the point„ÄÇ

So that's how you work with the declare command Now let's move on to the next topic which is arrays Okay„ÄÇ

 so now let's go ahead and let's try to run a script first of all we try to write a script and then we will try to run the script and in that script we see that how we can actually you know declare an array and how we can play with it alright„ÄÇ

 so let's get started so let's create an array of cards OkayÔºå so let's say the first core as BMW„ÄÇ

The second callÔºå let's sayÔºå Toyota„ÄÇAnd the third carÔºå let's say„ÄÇHndaÔºå okay„ÄÇ

So remember that this is the syntax of creating an array so you've got to have like these spaces inside each value and you've got to have these brackets around those values okay so you can add as many values as you want I would like to add three and then let's go ahead and let's try to print all of these values out so let's see how we can do that„ÄÇ

So there is a very simple way of doing it„ÄÇ Then we'd write here after dollar sign we'd write here the curly braces and inside of those curly braces„ÄÇ

 we write the variable name of arrayÔºå which is essentially core„ÄÇ

 And at the rate this sign basically you knowÔºå prints out all of the array„ÄÇ So we go ahead„ÄÇ

 we write hereÔºå the script nameÔºå which is essentially hello„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_17.png)

And we hit enterÔºå and you can see that basically we have all these three values printed outÔºå rightÔºü

So now there are other functionalities that you can perform as well„ÄÇ

 Basically you understand that how to declare an array you understand how to print all the values So there is another way that you can actually print out the values by index as well So for example the first value of an array is always stored on zero index the second one is always stored on the first index and the third one is always stored on the second index so the array is the array basically it always starts from0 okay so01 to so let's say I want to access this value So I have to mention the index as0 okay here so now only BMW will be printed up So let's go ahead and let's try to run our script„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_19.png)

So you can see that only BMW has been printed out okay„ÄÇSo if you want to print out Toyota„ÄÇ

 so you have to just you knowÔºå change the indexÔºå so you go aheadÔºå you run your script„ÄÇLet me„ÄÇ

So you can see that basically Toyota has been printed out hereÔºå okayÔºü

üéºSo there is another thing that you can do„ÄÇ and that is basicallyÔºå you can„ÄÇ

 let's see what happens with this command„ÄÇ I was actually„ÄÇYou knowÔºå working with it„ÄÇ

 so we put an exclamation mark here„ÄÇ

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_21.png)

And we save itÔºå we go back and it will basically it will show you the indexesÔºå yesÔºå so 01Ôºå2„ÄÇ

 so these are the present indexes in this area„ÄÇ So for example„ÄÇ

 if I enter another value like let's say you know rowver so if I save it„ÄÇ

And if I run my script againÔºå you can see that the index has been increased„ÄÇFrom here„ÄÇ

 and the value has been displayed here as wellÔºå okay„ÄÇ

So the next thing that I would like to show you is that how many values are in there„ÄÇ

 so if you want to calculate thatÔºå so you would just simply you just have to write here hashÔºå okay„ÄÇ

And you're good to go„ÄÇ so you save itÔºå you go backÔºå you try to run your script„ÄÇ

 and you can see that its it tells you that how many values are actually in there in this areaÔºå1Ôºå2Ôºå3„ÄÇ

4Ôºå allright„ÄÇSo these kind of stuffÔºå you knowÔºå these kind of things„ÄÇ

 these kind of tricks are valuable and very important when you're actually dealing withÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 areas which have hundreds of values insideÔºå okayÔºüSo„ÄÇThen„ÄÇ

Once you have done that there are other things that you can do as well„ÄÇ So for example„ÄÇ

 if you don't like any valueÔºå you want to delete that„ÄÇ So for exampleÔºå Honda„ÄÇ

 So I want to delete that„ÄÇ So first of all I need to determine that on which index this value resides right So you know I know that 0„ÄÇ

1Ôºå2„ÄÇ So the second index rightÔºå actually the third index„ÄÇ

 but with respect to the numbering it's 2 Okay so what I'm going do here I'm going to write here ns onsetet I'm going to write here the variable name and then I'm going to write inside of that the index which is essentially2„ÄÇ

So after doing thatÔºå I'm going to save it and when I'm going to run my script„ÄÇ

Honda is nowhere to be foundÔºå so you can see that the index„ÄÇ

 the2 has been removed as well and the value the values„ÄÇ

 total number of values have been decreased as wellÔºå okay„ÄÇSo in the similar way„ÄÇ

 let's say I want to add that value backÔºå so there are you know two ways either I can you know„ÄÇ

 just simply remove this onset„ÄÇOr let's say„ÄÇI want to add another value„ÄÇ

 I want to replace this Honda sort of thing„ÄÇ So for thatÔºå what I would do„ÄÇüéºActually„ÄÇ

 after this onsetÔºå I can you know set the value of the array by writing here just simply Car2„ÄÇ

 and then I would write here the valueÔºå let's say the new value Mercedes„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇSo I save it„ÄÇ

 I go ahead and I try to run my scriptÔºå and you can see„ÄÇ

That basically the values have got back to four„ÄÇAnd we have got Mercedes in place of Honda on the second index„ÄÇ

 and it shows us thus2 the number to index as well hereÔºå okayÔºå which is actually third„ÄÇ

üéºSo I hope you have got the point So that's it from the array variable„ÄÇ

 So now let's go back and let's see what is our next topic„ÄÇ

 So the next topic is related to functions Okay so let's go back and let's try to run functions now okay so the way to write the function is something like this So you write here function and then you write the function name„ÄÇ

 whatever it is and then you write here brackets and then you basically create the body of the function inside which you will write code Okay so let's say I just write here a simple echo command„ÄÇ

 let's say echo„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇThis is new functionÔºå okay„ÄÇSo the way to call this functionÔºå so first of all„ÄÇ

 to in order to make this function work you have to call this function„ÄÇ

 so the idea is that in programming when you are working you might have a lot of code like you know„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå this line of code and let's say you have 60 lines of code„ÄÇ

 let's say and you have a total number of programÔºå the total number of lines in the program that is 10„ÄÇ

000 and there is some specific piece of code which consists of 60 lines and it has been used in those 10„ÄÇ

000 lineÔºå let's say five times okay„ÄÇSo now you don't have to copy and paste those 60 lines over and over again for you know five times„ÄÇ

 you don't need to do that what would you do that you would paste those 60 lines inside this function here„ÄÇ

And wherever you need to use those 60 linesÔºå you are not going to paste those 60 lines again„ÄÇ

 what you're going do„ÄÇ You're just going to call the function„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so like here„ÄÇ

 I'm going to call this function and let's save it„ÄÇ so first of all„ÄÇ

 let me show you what happens if I if we don't call the function„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so I'm going to go here„ÄÇ

 I'm going you know run my script and you can see nothing happensÔºå Okay„ÄÇ

 because I haven't called the function so if I call the function now here„ÄÇ

 if I call the function here like let's say„ÄÇFunction name„ÄÇ I save it„ÄÇ I run my script again„ÄÇ

 and you can see that it says this is new functionÔºå right„ÄÇ

So now what you can do is that you can actuallyÔºå you knowÔºå write different kind of functions„ÄÇ So„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå you can write functions with arguments„ÄÇ So let's sayÔºå you knowÔºå this„ÄÇ

 I call this functionÔºå let's say„ÄÇFunctionÔºå printÔºå okay„ÄÇAnd I echo in hereÔºå let's say taller 1„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I want to take the argument„ÄÇ So what I'm going to do is that I'm going to write here function print„ÄÇ

And then I'm going to give it the argument„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so argument could beÔºå let's say„ÄÇHiÔºå O„ÄÇ

So now Ive save it and if I go backÔºå if I try to run my scriptÔºå you can see that it says hiÔºå right„ÄÇ

 because I've given the argumentÔºå I have passed the I have asked for the argument and I have passed the argument„ÄÇ

And it has basically printed out the argument okay„ÄÇ

So another thing that you can do that you can actually pass multiple arguments as well„ÄÇ

 So for example„ÄÇüéºI write here $1 $234 OkayÔºå so I I say here I pass argument hi„ÄÇ

 this is Linux hand OkayÔºå so I save it I go back here I try to run my script and you can see that it has basically printed out hi this is Linux hand so that's how basically you pass an argument alright„ÄÇ

So the next thing that I'm going to show you is that how you can actually check„ÄÇ

Whether you know the thing is working or notÔºå so the function is actually working or not„ÄÇ

So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a function here and we'll see that if that function basically returns our value or not„ÄÇ

 So were right hereÔºå let's sayÔºå let's call this function„ÄÇFunctionÔºå check„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇAnd weÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 just right hereÔºå let's sayÔºå returning value„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇAnd we say„ÄÇUsing function right now„ÄÇO„ÄÇAnd then„ÄÇ

We echo this value inside this function„ÄÇO„ÄÇEcho„ÄÇAnd thenÔºå weÔºå basically„ÄÇYou know„ÄÇ

 right here returning„ÄÇValue„ÄÇAll rightÔºå so we save itÔºå so we come here and we basically you know„ÄÇ

 try to call the function„ÄÇOkayÔºå functionÔºå check„ÄÇSo we save itÔºå and we go ahead„ÄÇ

We try to run our script and you can see that it says using function right now„ÄÇ

 so you can say that this is the local variable that we have created and we have printed it out inside the function and then we have called the function okay„ÄÇ

So„ÄÇUsing this thingÔºå you can do another thing„ÄÇ So let's say that we don't print out this value right now here„ÄÇ

And let's change the value toÔºå let's say„ÄÇI love LinuxÔºå okayÔºü

And then let's say I create another variable hereÔºå returning value„ÄÇAnd in here„ÄÇI write here„ÄÇ

I love Mac„ÄÇO„ÄÇSo„ÄÇWhat happened is that now if I echo the returning value„ÄÇ

 let me just copy this variable„ÄÇO„ÄÇSo I don't make any spell mistake„ÄÇ

 So if I echo it right here now you can see that you can tell that it would print out basically this value„ÄÇ

 I love Mac„ÄÇ but if I call my functionÔºå which is essentially function check„ÄÇ

üéºAnd then I echo the same variableÔºå like you knowÔºå the returning value„ÄÇ

 the result would be different„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so let's see how it would work„ÄÇüéºSo we' save it„ÄÇ

 we go back to our scriptÔºå let me clear thatÔºå we try to run it„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_23.png)

And you can see that first it prints out I love Mac and then it prints out I love Linux„ÄÇ

 So the idea is that we have local function„ÄÇ This is a local function sorry the local variable which is inside the function and this variable towards the value I love Linux then we create another variable So basically the idea is that you cannot access this variable outside this function because this is a local variable and it can only be accessed inside the function body right So when you create another variable returning value it doesn't mind and it let you create another variable okay„ÄÇ

And you change the value you give it I love MacÔºå so basically it prints out this one„ÄÇ

 I love Mac hereÔºå but when you call the function now when you when you're calling the function now we have got returning value as I love Linux okay so basically what happens is that this returning value has been updated right here okay because of the calling of the function„ÄÇ

And then when you echo itÔºå you get this I love Linux Okay so you can see that it here we have I love Mac and then here we have I Linux„ÄÇ

 AllrightÔºå so I hope you have got a point so that was about functions So our next topic is about files in directory so we would go back to our hello script do S and in the topics of files and directories what we would do that first of all we would learn how to create directories and then we'd see that how to check if that directory„ÄÇ

 the current directory exists or not and then we would check how to create a file„ÄÇ

 then we' check how to check a file if that file exists or not and we'll also see that how we can append text to the file how we can read from the file line by line and finally we would see how can we actually delete the file as well so let's get started with this thing So first of all„ÄÇ

 let's create we all know that if you are familiar with„ÄÇ

The command line in order to create directoryÔºå you have to do something like NKD IR and then basically you have to create a folder right a folder name okay folder„ÄÇ

Like this„ÄÇ OkayÔºå or I I write here„ÄÇDirecty2„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so what would happen when you would create it„ÄÇ

 And if you execute this command twice twiceÔºå it would give you an error„ÄÇ

 So in order to avoid that errorÔºå in order to recreate the same directory or in order to you know„ÄÇ

 eat up the error in order to have that thing in the placeÔºå we write this flag negative P„ÄÇ

 So write here control S and then wed go to our terminal and we'd query it So„ÄÇ

Now we will try to run our scriptÔºå which is Hello script„ÄÇ We hit enter„ÄÇ

 and you can see that directory2 has been created„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now if we want to check that if that directory exists or not for that„ÄÇ

 we have to write a formal script„ÄÇ So right here echo„ÄÇ and first of allÔºå let's save right here enter„ÄÇ

Diiry name„ÄÇDiirectctory name to check„ÄÇOkayÔºå so then we'd basically read it and we' write here direct„ÄÇ

 So let's say direct is the variableÔºå which would basically store the name of the directory„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 and then wed write here if and then obviously would write here the brackets and inside here we write a negative D flag„ÄÇ

 which basically represents the checking of the fileÔºå it will basically help us check the file„ÄÇ

 sorryÔºå the directory if the directory exists or not„ÄÇ sod write here the variable name„ÄÇ

 and the variable name will contain the fileÔºå the directory nameÔºå whichever the user would enter„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so whichever name the user would enterÔºå it would be stored in the variable name as direct„ÄÇ

 And then we'd write here then„ÄÇAnd then we write here E statement„ÄÇ

 which would say something like thisÔºå you knowÔºå directory exists„ÄÇOkayÔºå and if it doesn't exist„ÄÇ

 if this statement is not trueÔºå then we'd echo that directory does not exist„ÄÇOkayÔºå simple is that„ÄÇ

 Then we' write here F IÔºå which would basically simply end this if statement„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now if we save itÔºå we go aheadÔºå we try to run our script„ÄÇ

We'd get something like this enter directory name to check„ÄÇ So first of all„ÄÇ

 we'd enter a name that actually doesn't exist„ÄÇ So it right hereÔºå let's say J K L„ÄÇ

 So we hit enter and it says J K L doesn't exist„ÄÇ OkayÔºå and that is true„ÄÇ then again„ÄÇ

 we'd run our script„ÄÇAfter running our scriptÔºå what we would do we enter the name of the directory which does exist„ÄÇ

 So right hereÔºå let's say new folder„ÄÇ So you can see that it says new folder exists„ÄÇ

 So if we do that the same thing for directory to you can see that it says directory2 exists okay so I hope you have got the point„ÄÇ

 So that's how basically you check if the directory exists or not So the next thing that we are going to do is that we are going to create a file Okay so we are going to write a script that will help us create a file„ÄÇ

 So we we'll just simply keep the code hereÔºå we right here echo enter the file name to create okay„ÄÇ

And after writing that with change the variable nameÔºå let's say we write here file„ÄÇ

Name okay and then we come to the next line and now what we do with right here a touch command so touch command basically helps us create the file so right here file name and obviously I think it we have to give a dollar sign here as well and then we save it we go back to our terminal we try to run our script„ÄÇ

 So first of all notice down here that we have only handful of files and folders here So if we run our script now and we enter a file name let's say I enter here Linux„ÄÇ

So you can see that basically this is the file Linux that have been created and it's on my desktop so now what I can do is that I can also check if this file exists or not right so for that what we can do is that we can actually you know bring back that if statement I think that we had yes and we can right here enter„ÄÇ

File name„ÄÇTo check okay and here we can have the variable named as file name and then we can here here we can have the negative F flag„ÄÇ

 which basically represents the file„ÄÇ OkayÔºå it works in the cases of file only So negative D was for directory„ÄÇ

 So here we write here the file name which is file name and then we write here„ÄÇ

üéºThat file name existsÔºå basically the variableÔºå the whatever the file name isÔºå it exists„ÄÇ

 And if somehow this statement is not trueÔºå it's false„ÄÇ

 then what we would do is that we would write here file name„ÄÇüéºDoesn't exist„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I hope you've got the point„ÄÇ So we press control S we'd save it would come here„ÄÇ

 we run our script„ÄÇ We hit enter„ÄÇ It says enter file name to check„ÄÇ So first of all„ÄÇ

 I intentionally am going to put a wrong file name so it says J E O doesn't exist Okay so again„ÄÇ

 I'm going run my script and now I'm going to put my file name and I'm going to write here Linux and you can see that it says Linux exist„ÄÇ

 So we can try it out for other files as well that we have on our you know here„ÄÇ So for example„ÄÇ

 if I say if I say like file1 dot text„ÄÇSo let's see what happens„ÄÇ It says file 1 dot text exists„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so I hope you' have got the point„ÄÇ So the next thing that we want to do is that we want to append the text into the file„ÄÇ

 So appending means essentially that you're basically adding the file adding the text excuse me inside the file and whatever text is already in there„ÄÇ

 it's not actually going to replace it„ÄÇ it's not going to remove it„ÄÇ it's going to add ahead of it„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so we would see how we can do it„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so„ÄÇWe go ahead first of all„ÄÇ

 we see we would basically enter right hereÔºå enter the file name„ÄÇIn which you want to appendÔºå okay„ÄÇ

In which you want to app so first of allÔºå obviously we're gonna check if the file exists or not„ÄÇ

 because if a user somehow enters the wrong file name„ÄÇ

 obviously then we cannot append into it right so file has to be there So we would check the file and now in here instead of echo what we would do we would write here„ÄÇ

In factÔºå we need echo with right here enter„ÄÇThe text„ÄÇüéºThat you want to app„ÄÇ OkayÔºå then we write here„ÄÇ

 readÔºå and then we write hereÔºå file„ÄÇText„ÄÇOkayÔºå let's name this variable as file text„ÄÇ

 And then what we're gonna do is that we're gonna write here an echo statement„ÄÇ

 and then we're gonna write here the variable file text„ÄÇ

 and then now notice it that I'm going put double angle brackets here because I want to append in the file„ÄÇ

 Okay I want to append into the file„ÄÇ And in case if I want to replace the text which is already there„ÄÇ

 I want to remove it and I want to put in this new fileÔºå I just have to you knowÔºå this new text„ÄÇ

 excuse meÔºå I just have to just write this thing once„ÄÇ Okay the angle bracket„ÄÇ

 But now I write here twice because I want to append„ÄÇ

 I don't want the previous text to be removed Okay„ÄÇ

 otherwise obviously if that file doesn't exist then this message is right„ÄÇ So we save it„ÄÇ

 So first of allÔºå we're gonna put in the wrong file name intentionally So at JK it says a JK doesn't exist„ÄÇ

 we're again gonna run our program„ÄÇOr script„ÄÇ And then we're going„ÄÇType in the file name„ÄÇ

 So let's say I want to append in this file„ÄÇ and this file is basically empty right now„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so we right here LinuxÔºå the file nameÔºå It says it basically let me go ahead„ÄÇ

 It says enter the text that you want to append„ÄÇ So I write here this„ÄÇIs the Linux„ÄÇ

File from Linux hint„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so I hit enter and if I go back hereÔºå I check it„ÄÇ

 you can see that this is the Linux file from Linux hint that's the text that is inside the file„ÄÇ

 So now if I would run the script again and if I would do the same thing now it would not actually replace or remove that it would actually add into it So if I write here hi this is the second„ÄÇ

Time I am appending„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so if I hit enter and if I go back here„ÄÇ

 you can see that basically it has basically appended the text into the into the same fileÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 it has not removed it or replaced itÔºå howeverÔºå if I just go here and if I just simply removed this one angle bracket and if I save it and if I go back and if I try to run my script again and you know„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_25.png)

I am not app„ÄÇIf I add thatÔºå if I hit enter and if I go back to links„ÄÇ

 now you can see that basically those two lines are gone„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so now what it has done„ÄÇ

 it has replaced it„ÄÇ AlrightÔºå so remember that in order to append„ÄÇ Basically„ÄÇ

 you just have to put these double angle brackets„ÄÇ OkayÔºå I hope you've got the point„ÄÇ

 So now we would basically see that how we can actually read the file line by line as well„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so let's go ahead this is the„ÄÇSo I'm gonna add a few of the lines„ÄÇ So let's say this is Linux„ÄÇ

 This is Linux hint„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so I save it„ÄÇ And what I'm going do that I'm just going to make a few changes in this script„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so I'm going IÔºå I want to read this file line by line„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so I'll write here„ÄÇ

 enter file name„ÄÇFrom which you want to read„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so from which„ÄÇYou want to read„ÄÇAlright„ÄÇ

 so then what I would do is that I would go here and I would write here read file name and then after that I would go here and obviously I want to keep it because I want to check the file if the file exists then I want to read line by line right so what I would do I would come here and from here I would start writing the code okay so Id remove these three lines and I would write here a while block while„ÄÇ

And I write here ifFS equalsÔºå and then I' would write here read negative R„ÄÇ

 and then I' would write here line„ÄÇAllrightÔºå that Ill right here do and I'llequate the line obviously that Im reading and then basically done„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so now the while loop has finished here so one thing one thing to remember that this statement is while read negative R which is a reading flag and line So this ifFS here we have used it for dealing with white spaces„ÄÇ

 Okay so you can also write it like this so basically it is having what just an empty string right so you can do that this way or you can just simply remove it would assume that it has an empty string okay so I hope you've got the point so you know everything is fine so it control s and one thing that I'm forgetting is that I want to give here the file name right because from that file I'm going to read and on that file I'm going to implement this while loop right so I write here„ÄÇ

The file name So now if you have noticed that previously when we were appending or replacing the text in the file„ÄÇ

 the direction of this angle bracketÔºå it was exactly opposite right because in that case we were basically adding into the file Okay so now basically you can see that the angle bracket is towards the file so it means basically we are reading from the file Okay so you've got the point so now which save it„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåAnd we'd go ahead and we try to run our script so first of all I put in the wrong file name it says doesn't exist„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to clear itÔºå I run my script again and now I'm going to write here file name from which I want to read okay so I would write here Linux„ÄÇ

I hit enter end you can see that it is basically reading right from the fileÔºå okay„ÄÇSoÔºå you can see„ÄÇ

AlrightÔºå so now finally we could see that how we can actually delete the file„ÄÇ It's very simple„ÄÇ

 So obviously first of allÔºå the file has to exist right So we're write here simply RM and then we' write here file name„ÄÇ

ActuallyÔºå the radio name„ÄÇüéºAnd obviously if we if we put in the wrong file name it doesn't it won't delete it okay„ÄÇ

 so like this it says doesn't exist obviously you can add the line that it doesn't exist and it can be deleted obviously okay„ÄÇ

üéºSo I'd go here and I'd type in the file nameÔºå which is Linux„ÄÇ I hit enterÔºå and you can see boom„ÄÇ

 The file has been deleted„ÄÇ What you can do is that you can echo here as wellÔºå echo„ÄÇFile„ÄÇHas been„ÄÇ

Delet it successfully„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇSo you save it and now let me go ahead and let let me try to delete this file1 dot text„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå we don't have anything inside that„ÄÇ So yesÔºå we save it„ÄÇ

 We go back and we try to run our scriptÔºå okay„ÄÇAnd you know we type in the file name which is file1 dot text we hit enter and you can see that file has been removed and it says file has been deleted successfully Okay„ÄÇ

 so I hope you have got the point and now let's move on to the next topic which is essentially I think we already have it open here„ÄÇ

Yes„ÄÇSo the next topic is sending an email via script„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so the next topic is sending email via scriptÔºå So there are several methods to send an email via script„ÄÇ

 but we're gonna follow a very simple one So first of all what you've got to do is in order to you know work with emails what you've got to do you have to install first of all pseudo app install S M Tp okay„ÄÇ

 you hit enter and you install this„ÄÇ OkayÔºå I already have it so it it has taken less time„ÄÇ

 but when you install it for the first time it would probably take longer okay„ÄÇ

So the second step that you've got to do is that you have to edit a file„ÄÇ

 we can also save the configuration fileÔºå but before that you have to go to your Google account„ÄÇ

 so I have created this testing Google account and what you've got to do you have got to go to the Google account here„ÄÇ

NowÔºå after coming on this pageÔºå you have to click on this security tab„ÄÇAnd you have to come down„ÄÇ

And from hereÔºå you have to turn the access on OkayÔºå so I already have turned the access on„ÄÇ

 so you have to allow less secure apps and you have to turn it on OkayÔºå so by default„ÄÇ

 it would be off like this„ÄÇ but you have to turn it on„ÄÇ OkayÔºå make sure that this sign is blue„ÄÇ

So once you have done thatÔºå now what you've got to do is that you have to go back to your terminal„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_27.png)

And in hereÔºå you have to actually open up your file„ÄÇSlash EDCÔºå slash„ÄÇSÔºå SMTP slash S SMTP dot com„ÄÇ

 okay„ÄÇ

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_29.png)

You hit enterÔºå you open this file okayÔºå and now what you're going to do is that you're going to edit it„ÄÇ

So I'm going to write here root„ÄÇEquals here you are going to write your email„ÄÇIn my case„ÄÇ

 it's testing email430 at emailmail„ÄÇcom„ÄÇOkayÔºå so make sure whenever you're allowing access to less secure ads make sure that is some account that you really don't care about okay„ÄÇ

 otherwiseÔºå you know if if in case that account is important and you have very some important information in it„ÄÇ

 then I don't recommend trying it on that okay„ÄÇThen you write here mail hub„ÄÇüéºAnd then you write here„ÄÇ

 SMMTP dot Google„ÄÇOur James Gmail„ÄÇDot co and then you write here column and then the TlS port number„ÄÇ

 which is 587 in case of SSL it is 465„ÄÇAnd then you write hereÔºå authenticated user„ÄÇ

 which is going be obviously the user nameÔºå which is testing email 4Ôºå30„ÄÇ

Like the email that I have created„ÄÇAnd then obviously„ÄÇ

 you're going to write here authentication password„ÄÇWhich I'm not going to write here right now„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå because it is not in dark star sortÔºå so it is in literal wordsÔºå okay„ÄÇ

So I'm going to write down that later„ÄÇThen we're going to right hereÔºå use start„ÄÇDlS is equal to yes„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so that's all that's all you have to do„ÄÇ So now I'm going to write here my password and I'm going to save this file and close it„ÄÇ

 So after saving itÔºå after saving this fileÔºå what you've got to do is that you have to come here„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_31.png)

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_32.png)

And now you can actuallyÔºå edit your script„ÄÇAnd you can runÔºå okayÔºüLet me open that to„ÄÇ

So now there are basically two fundamental waysÔºå either you can actually create a text file in which you structure your email and you basically redirect your command to that file or there is another way that is simpler so what I'm going to do I'm going to write here SSMTP„ÄÇ

And then I'm going to write here the email addressÔºå OkayÔºå which is this one„ÄÇAnd simple is that„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I'm going to save it„ÄÇWhenm to come hereÔºå I'm going to run my strip„ÄÇ

So when you run your script you would see something like this so in here you can actually structure your email first of all do to the person that you're sending an email to so you're going to write here the email address so for example„ÄÇ

 in my case this is the email address that I want to send to„ÄÇThen I'm going to have fromÔºå obviously„ÄÇ

 I'm sending an email„ÄÇI'm sending an email to myselfÔºå okay„ÄÇThen I can have C„ÄÇ

And let's say ICC myself„ÄÇÈÇ£Ë∑ü„ÄÇ4Ôºå30 at Gmail dot com„ÄÇThen we can have your subject„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 and then we have party„ÄÇ this is„ÄÇOkayÔºå so after that you press control D and you can you come out of it in control D„ÄÇ

 we would go back to our browser I would see that the email has arrived okay„ÄÇ

So here you can see that this is the email that I have sent to myself if I go to S you can see here it exists as well and in the inbox it exists as well„ÄÇ

 so that's how you basically send yourself an email using SSMTP not sending yourself essentially but you can send to other people as well„ÄÇ

 but I'll recommend that you use your extra account for these kind of activities because it's way too dangerous and that's why Google does not recommend that as well„ÄÇ

So certainly there are other ways to send emails as well„ÄÇ

 like using send email mail mail access as wellÔºå you can go ahead and check out that ways as well„ÄÇ

So our next topic is a curl„ÄÇ OkayÔºå the curl in script„ÄÇ So if you have been working with the command„ÄÇ

 then you you must be familiar with this and if you want to know more about it„ÄÇ

 then you can just go and on your terminal write down man curl or I think curlhen help as well„ÄÇ

 these things would work and you you'd be able to see that how many things that you can do with this command„ÄÇ

 So basically today in this topic what you'm gonna do is that I'm gonna write here a simple curl and we try to download something„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so right here URL and„ÄÇBut right here URL equals and inside these double chs„ÄÇ

 I'm going to write a URL so„ÄÇI'm going to go to my browser and I'm going to write hereÔºå test„ÄÇ

 download„ÄÇÂø´Êúâ„ÄÇI'm gonna hit enter and obviously it would show us that how many like test files that you can download„ÄÇ

 So let me just click on let me just I think this would work for us„ÄÇ

 So let me just download this small fileÔºå which is I think it's one MB„ÄÇ I guess„ÄÇ

 so I copy the link OkayÔºå I think this one is a one MB„ÄÇ It is smaller than that„ÄÇ So„ÄÇ

I'm just going to put in the URLÔºå and I'm just going to save it„ÄÇ

Save the script and I'd go back to my terminal and I'd try to basically run the script okay„ÄÇ

So right hereÔºå hello doscript„ÄÇset and you can see that it says it gives us some sort of warning because probably we are not doing it right„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå so because we are doing it through scriptÔºå it is showing some sort of problem so rather what we are going to do is that we are going to make a few changes„ÄÇ

We are just going to simply write here angle bracket„ÄÇ

 and then we're going to write here the file lane„ÄÇ OkayÔºå that that file lane that we want to give it„ÄÇ

 So would right hereÔºå let's say„ÄÇLet me download it first as it is OkayÔºå so first of all„ÄÇ

 if we do that we if we put here negative OÔºå then it would inherit the file name„ÄÇ

 the actual file name okayÔºå so if we control asset we go to our terminal and we try to run our script„ÄÇ

So you can see that it it has started to download and this is the original file name Okay„ÄÇ

 so basically it has inherited that file name okay1 M O dot D80 okay„ÄÇ

So it is like 44% it's been done„ÄÇAnd obviouslyÔºå total is almost 100„ÄÇ1001000Ôºå excuse me 1024 k„ÄÇ

 So it's around 1 M„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so it has downloaded that file and you can see that it has inherited the name„ÄÇ

 the original name of the fileÔºå which is you know one MIO file Okay„ÄÇ

 so that is the original line name that it has taken it from the website and website obviously they would have stored it in their database„ÄÇ

 So in their databaseÔºå the name of the file is this one MIO dot T„ÄÇ So what Im what I'm gonna do now„ÄÇ

 let's try to change the file name„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so let's try here curve„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_34.png)

Not here„ÄÇ actuallyÔºå I think inside hereÔºå Yes„ÄÇ So what we're going to do is that we're going to write here negative O„ÄÇ

AllrightÔºå and„ÄÇObviouslyÔºå negative O stands for optionsÔºå save as options„ÄÇ

 and then we're going to write here the name of the file that we want to give„ÄÇ

 So let's give it like new file download„ÄÇOr D W„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so we save it„ÄÇ

 We go ahead and we try to run our script again„ÄÇExcuse me for that„ÄÇ

 So we try to run our script again and you can see that it has started to download„ÄÇ

 So once it would downloadÔºå you can see that basically it has changed the file name here Okay so curve command is basically used is basically used to download different stuff„ÄÇ

 So what you can do is that you can also check if the file has the right data right so for that what you would do„ÄÇ

 you would just simply check the header and then you can decide if you have to download this file or not So we'd get into that„ÄÇ

 But first I think in order to do the same thing there is another way we'd write here an angle bracket this way and then we'd write here the file name let's say we write here output file Okay so we save it„ÄÇ

And we go ahead and we try to run itÔºå run the script again„ÄÇ

 and you can see that basically it has started to download it„ÄÇAnd this would be now our output file„ÄÇ

 but would in it would be actually in here on our desktopÔºå okayÔºüSo I hope you've got the point„ÄÇ

 This is how basically you can do such stuff and now what we're gonna do is that we're gonna take a look at the headers So header as I have mentioned that you can check headers the data that is coming from headers you don't you don't have to necessarily download all the file or complete file to know if that file is okay or not or if that file is correct or not you can just download the header a small amount of the file and you can know that if that file is right„ÄÇ

 obviously you are not going to download 10 gigte of the file to know that if that file is right or wrong because that is going say based a lot of your time So in order to save your time this is the trick so write here curve and URL obviously would keep it the same but before that we write negative or hyphen and then we write here capital I okay„ÄÇ

Now wed save itÔºå so that is very simple so we'll clear it and now we' right here the name of our script we hit enter and you can see that this is the information of the file that we would get„ÄÇ

Wwhichch will help us to make a decisionN if we had to download this file or not„ÄÇ

 so you can see that HtTP 1„ÄÇ1200 okay obviously if youre familiar with the networking„ÄÇ

 this is a message that you know this thing is okay with the networking you can download it or you can work with it„ÄÇ

 then we have got the date„ÄÇThen we've got the server last modified obviously this is the information that could be very helpful„ÄÇ

 the except rangersÔºå the content lengthÔºå the connection and the content type okay so I hope you have got the point so this is how you basically get the information about the file this is the header of the file and based on that you can make the DCN if you have to download the file or not„ÄÇ

So the next topic that we're going to discuss is„ÄÇProfessional menu right so professionalal menus in this topic„ÄÇ

 we are going study select loopÔºå how to work with it„ÄÇ

 and we're also gonna discuss that how you can actually wait for the input okay so that is also possible will see that how we can actually work with these two things„ÄÇ

 we've done a few examples„ÄÇ so without a further ado let's let's go ahead and let's do that as well„ÄÇ

 So now we're just you know remove it„ÄÇ So what we're gonna do is that we're going to write here as select loop and in that select loop you know I'm obsessed with cars„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to write here the car company names B AndW Mercedes Tesla Rover range Rover and then let's say Toyota So you can see that I have one„ÄÇ

2Ôºå3Ôºå4Ôºå5 car companies name and I write here do and the good thing about select loop is that it gives you„ÄÇ

Options okay automatically so what you've got to do is that you have to select one option and when you select that option what's going to happen that it is automatically going to print out that option in this variable it is going to actually store that option in this variable and then obviously using this variable you can print it out okay„ÄÇ

So I'm going to write here E and I'm going to write here you have selected„ÄÇDollar sign„ÄÇ

 and then call the variable name„ÄÇ And then I write here done„ÄÇ So all done„ÄÇ

 And we go back and we try to run our script„ÄÇ OkayÔºå and you can see that it says some sort of error„ÄÇ

 Select car„ÄÇ I think after carÔºå I have to write here in„ÄÇ YesÔºå I forgot that„ÄÇ So we save it„ÄÇ

 So these little mistakesÔºå you knowÔºå you can everybody could make it„ÄÇ So no big deal„ÄÇ

 So after writing in after improving the mistakeÔºå we run our script again„ÄÇ

 And you can see that we have five options„ÄÇ So from these five options„ÄÇ

 we can select any of the options„ÄÇ So let's say I select two„ÄÇlet me just by mistake„ÄÇ

 I press some other key so I press two so you can see that it says you have selected Mercedes one„ÄÇ

 it says you have selected BMW3Ôºå it says you have selected Tesla 4 pro5 you have selected Toyota So one thing if you have noticed that other than5 if I select any other option„ÄÇ

 let's say press D it says you have selected Okay so the car variable is basically empathy right„ÄÇSo„ÄÇ

There are basically fundamentally different ways to do that„ÄÇ but what we do„ÄÇ

 you can you know write a statement and you can put a check on that but we can actually create a switch statement right inside the select loop and we can actually make it happen right so let's say in in the you know in the switch statement we've got something called as default statement Okay so in that default statement we could say error okay put the right number alright„ÄÇ

 so right now we go here case and then we write here the variable name„ÄÇ

 which is essentially car and then we write here in the keyword and then we write here BMW our first option and then we'll echo it right we echo let me just you know„ÄÇ

Acur„ÄÇSo E BMW selected„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇDouble Collins„ÄÇ Then we come here„ÄÇ

 and then we write here the next car nameÔºå which is essentially MercedesÔºå and we write here„ÄÇEcho„ÄÇ

Mercedes„ÄÇSelect itÔºå okayÔºå and then you put double columns„ÄÇ

 Then you come here and then you write here Tesla„ÄÇ Let me just basically copy it and just edit it„ÄÇ

So I copy itÔºå I come here„ÄÇAnd I press hereÔºå you knowÔºå TeslaÔºå I change it to TeslaÔºå basicallyÔºå okay„ÄÇ

And then I change that as well quicklyÔºå Tesla„ÄÇI come hereÔºå I paste it again„ÄÇ I change that first„ÄÇ

To roller„ÄÇAnd then I change that to rover as well„ÄÇü§ßÂóØ„ÄÇExcuse me„ÄÇ So To right hereÔºå Toyota„ÄÇ

 and then obviously would right hereÔºå echo„ÄÇDo you the selected„ÄÇüéºAnd then finally„ÄÇ

 well write here a default statement by using stic okay„ÄÇ

 as we have learned previously as well when we were discussing case statements„ÄÇ

 So we are going to echo here error„ÄÇPlease„ÄÇSelect„ÄÇÂëÉ„ÄÇBetween„ÄÇAwen„ÄÇDo„ÄÇ5Ôºå O„ÄÇ

So that's how you basically do it„ÄÇ And in order to end the case statement„ÄÇ

 what you're gonna do you're gonna write here Eac„ÄÇ Okay so basically that's how you do it„ÄÇ

 So now you see a different thing So when go ahead and when we will run our script you can see that it has like one to 3„ÄÇ

4Ôºå5 option„ÄÇ So if I press2 it says Mercees selected if I press3„ÄÇ

 it says Teesla selected but if I press any other keyÔºå let's say n I hit enter and it says error„ÄÇ

 please select between one to 5 and if I select8Ôºå it says errorÔºå it says the same thing„ÄÇ

 So I have to select a numberÔºå which is between one and5 okay including one and5 select says select5 it says Toyota selected okay so it goes on and on and on So now discuss another example in which we wait for the input like for any key okay so you can use it as„ÄÇ

üéºlike in professional menus as well you knowÔºå differently it depends upon you so so I'm just going to teach you so we'd right here echo and then we'd right here press any key to continue„ÄÇ

So basically what would happen is that in this program in this script„ÄÇ

 we are just going to wait for the user to press a key until then we're going to give him remainders okay„ÄÇ

SoÔºå we will keep him„ÄÇSoÔºå we are going to use„ÄÇSo we're going to wait for the user to press any key until then we are going to give him or her reminders„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so we' right hereÔºå let's say a while loop„ÄÇAnd we're going to write here true if the while loop is true„ÄÇ

 what were going to do is that we're going to right here read„ÄÇ

üéºRemember here that we're going to write here T T basically stands for seconds„ÄÇ

 so after right after every three seconds it is going to print out a statement okay the else block let me show you what's going to happen so we're going to write here if„ÄÇ

And„ÄÇAfter thatÔºå after writing if statementÔºå we're going to write here question mark equals0„ÄÇ

If that happensÔºå if that condition is trueÔºå then„ÄÇWhat you do is that you basically exit„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 and before exitÔºå let'sÔºå let me just echo it here„ÄÇYou have„ÄÇDinated the script„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so otherwise I write here else block„ÄÇ and in else EÔºå I say„ÄÇWaiting„ÄÇFor you to press„ÄÇüéºThe key Sir„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå so„ÄÇOnce the user press the keyÔºå it presses the key and what happens is that basically the script stops running„ÄÇ

 otherwise it would keep on running and it would„ÄÇKeep on giving thisÔºå this reminder here„ÄÇ

 waiting for you to press the keyerÔºå and it would give this reminder after every three seconds„ÄÇ

 and it would basically print it out just onceÔºå okay„ÄÇüéºSo after that„ÄÇ

 obviously we need to end the while loop as wellÔºå so we control usÔºå we save it„ÄÇ

 we go back here and we try to run our script„ÄÇSo you can see that it expressed any key to continue„ÄÇ

 but after every three seconds it is„ÄÇPrinting it outÔºå waiting for you to press the key sir„ÄÇ

 waiting for you to press the key sirÔºå waiting for you to press the key sir„ÄÇ So what I'm gonna do„ÄÇ

 I'm gonna press any key or my keyboard„ÄÇ let's say I pressÔºå you know any key„ÄÇ

 So it says you have terminated the script„ÄÇ so basically that's how you work with it„ÄÇ

 So I have pressed why so that why is here know it is showing up so you can see that it says you have basically terminated the script„ÄÇ

 Okay so that's how you basically wait for the input„ÄÇ

 you wait for the user to give you the input and then you can perform any action„ÄÇ

 So I have performed what I have printed out you know„ÄÇ

 this thing and I have exited the script you can do anything else whatever you want to do here Okay so I have you got the point„ÄÇ

 So let's move on to the next topic„ÄÇ So wait for file system events with i notify So we're gonna discuss I notify this topic and what we're gonna do is that we're gonna wait for the„ÄÇ

And we're gonna make changes in the file and before using inotifyÔºå obviously you have to install it„ÄÇ

 So first of all inotify is basically iodeode notify okay so the i here it represents in and notifies like notify okay it is a Linux kernel subsystem that basically acts to extend file systems to notice changes to the file system applications and it replaces an earlier facility which was de notify I think and it had similar goals okay so whatever changes that you're gonna make to your directories or files inotifies when to tell you that these are the changes that have been made in your certain files and directories so that's how we're gonna use you can also say that basically it is you know we can use inotify to monitor the files and directories as well okay„ÄÇ

So now let's go ahead and let's startÔºå let's see what we can do with I notifyÔºå so first of all„ÄÇ

 obviously you have to install it„ÄÇIn order to install„ÄÇ

 you have to write something like pseudo app install„ÄÇAnd then you're gonna write hereÔºå I notify„ÄÇTool„ÄÇ

 so there are plenty of things that you can install with Inotify„ÄÇ

 but we want to install particularly inotify tools„ÄÇ So wed hit enter„ÄÇ It would ask us„ÄÇ

 do you want to continueÔºå So obviously we'd press yes and it would start working on it and it would start downloading it and it would start installing it„ÄÇ

 AllrightÔºå so it would take some time So once it download and it installs in our system and we'd run a few scripts and then we'd see that what we can do So now you can see that it is installed in our system„ÄÇ

 So let me just square it So now wed go back and we' try to write our script„ÄÇ Okay so„ÄÇ

Before we write our script so what I'm going do is that I'm just going to use i notify first of all on just an imaginary directory„ÄÇ

 So let's say there is let's say that there is a temporary directory that actually doesn't exist on our system right now on our desktop so let's see how I notify response to that so let's write here i notify and negative M or hyphen M and then I'm going write here slash temp and then slash new folder let's say„ÄÇ

And yeahÔºå that's pretty much it„ÄÇ So we controlÔºå save itÔºå we save it„ÄÇ and then let's go to here„ÄÇ

And then let's try to run our script„ÄÇ So you can see that it says i notify command not found„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so I think we need to write here I notify weight„ÄÇ YesÔºå I forgot to write hereÔºå i notify weight„ÄÇ

 we save it„ÄÇ and then we go backÔºå we try to run our script„ÄÇ

 you can see that it says setting a setting up watches„ÄÇ

 couldn't watch slash slash new folder no such file or directory exist„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so there is no file or or directory OkayÔºå something like that„ÄÇ

 So what I'm going do is that basically I'm going to create such a file at end directory„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to write here MD IR„ÄÇ and then I'm going write here negative P„ÄÇ

 and then I'm going to write here„ÄÇ I told you that why we write negative P and we write here slash„ÄÇ

 then we write here slash new folder„ÄÇ So once you have written this script and after that what you're going do is that you're going to press„ÄÇ

Ctrol S„ÄÇ and then basicallyÔºå you're going to go here and you're going to run your script and„ÄÇ

You know you'd see that basically the directory has been created and the watches the watches have been set to basically monitor your directories and files so right now we have created this one this is the temporary folder and there is a new folder inside of it or directories and you can see that we have set up an inotified wait command which is basically waiting and waiting and waiting for you know changes in this file so for example if I open it„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_36.png)

You can see that on the terminalÔºå it has given up the message that the directory has been opened rightÔºü

 So if I again click it and if I go back hereÔºå you can see that it has given again„ÄÇ

 it has given a message that that directory was opened„ÄÇ

 So what you can do is that you can write another script„ÄÇ So go ahead„ÄÇ

 this is your homework go ahead and create another second script and then you would do that„ÄÇ

 you would you you would do run that script in the second terminal and you would see that you know„ÄÇ

 those changes and obviously in that script in the second script„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_38.png)

And obviously in that second script you're going to make changes in in this directory„ÄÇ

 create another fileÔºå you know print out something inside that file and then lets then see that how these changes are made so we can create a file here actually that would be highly unprofessional because let's not do that let's create a file using command line or using a script so I'm just going do it quickly in the command in the terminal so what you can do is that you can actually create another script and try to run that script in another new terminal Okay so I'm opening up a new terminal and I'm just quickly going to create the new file so that you can see the changes that we are making okay„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_40.png)

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_41.png)

So we go hereÔºå let me see the other terminal„ÄÇI think we just have one terminal„ÄÇ YesÔºå here we have so„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_43.png)

What we do is that we basicallyÔºå you knowÔºå now you can basically see that what are the changes that have been made„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so I do something like thisÔºå I'll create this one a little bigger„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_45.png)

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_46.png)

üéºAnd here now if I try to create a fileÔºå let's say I create touch file 1 do test„ÄÇ

 you can do that inside the second script and run that script here„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 that doesn't really make a difference so you can see that it you know basically tells us that you have created the file okay„ÄÇ

And let's say that I want to add something to this file„ÄÇ

 So what I would do is that you know add right hereÔºå let's say„ÄÇ

So let's say that I want to add something inside the file„ÄÇ So let's say I echo here„ÄÇ

 This is Linux hint„ÄÇAnd then I go ahead andÔºå you knowÔºå I just„ÄÇüéºPaste that thing inside the file1„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so if I hit enterÔºå you can see that it'sÔºå it tells us that the file has been modified„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 it has been opened and it has been modified„ÄÇ Alright„ÄÇ

 so it basically gives every bit of the information about this file„ÄÇ So now if I„ÄÇ

 let's say I go ahead and I open it„ÄÇ

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_48.png)

You can see that here we have the textÔºå but if I go back to the terminal„ÄÇ

 you can see that it also has shown us that we have basically made opened up the file„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 you can see that we have opened the fileÔºå we have accessed it„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_50.png)

So that's how basically you can actually monitor your files and directories using inotify so certainly there are you know a thousand I think if not thousand I'm exaggerating maybe you know nearly hundred hundreds of commands that you can perform in hundred different ways so you know you can you can always consult man pages for that so go ahead check out man pages and see that what else you can do with inotify and perform some of the commands so practice is very important so it's like kthetic learning so if you do that you get ahead of the curve okay so must try it alright so now let's go ahead and let's move on to the next topic I think which is let me see that here„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_52.png)

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_53.png)

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_54.png)

So our next topic is introduction to Gr„ÄÇSo in this topic we try to do an example and wed see that what we can actually do with this Gr command Okay so let's go ahead„ÄÇ

 let's go back to our script which is hello script I guess yes„ÄÇ

 so what we are going to do is that we are going to create a script that will actually search from some file okay so let's let's go ahead and let's try to create another file so let's create a text file„ÄÇ

HereÔºå let's go back to terminal„ÄÇAnd let's create a file hereÔºå touch„ÄÇFileÔºå you knowÔºå file Gr„ÄÇNot„ÄÇSo„ÄÇ

 we created itÔºå and„ÄÇOopsÔºå I closed the terminalÔºå but don't worry we will open it„ÄÇ So inside here„ÄÇ

 we write something like this is„ÄÇLimux„ÄÇThis is Windows„ÄÇüéºAnd this is Mac„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so basically„ÄÇ

 these are the three lines that we have written„ÄÇ And now what we can do is that we can just simply copy paste on„ÄÇ

 okay„ÄÇSo we save it and now what we're going to do that we are going to search inside this file using Gr command„ÄÇ

 al rightÔºå so we open this up„ÄÇAnd we go to our text top because that's where our script resides and we go to our script„ÄÇ

 I think we need to open our script again„ÄÇ So in here we remove this„ÄÇAnd we write a program„ÄÇ

 So let's say we ask user to enter the inputÔºå the file file name„ÄÇ So we write here E„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇFile name„ÄÇ

To search extra„ÄÇOkayÔºå so then we read it and we say as file name„ÄÇAnd then we go ahead„ÄÇ

 we write an if condition„ÄÇ and in this if conditionÔºå we are going to check if the file exists or not„ÄÇ

 and that is something that we have done already as well„ÄÇWe use F flag„ÄÇ

 And then we write here the variable nameÔºå which is essentially file name„ÄÇAnd then after that„ÄÇ

 we write hereÔºå then„ÄÇThen we write hereÔºå EÔºå and then we write hereÔºå file„ÄÇExist„ÄÇIn fact„ÄÇ

 we don't need to write that„ÄÇ We would write here the code to receive theÔºå obviously the text„ÄÇ

 the that user want to search„ÄÇ OkayÔºå the word or something like that„ÄÇ So then we write here else„ÄÇ

 and then in hereÔºå were gonna write echo„ÄÇFile doesn't exist in the in thatÔºå in the case„ÄÇ

 a file does not exist in that case„ÄÇI'm gonna write here„ÄÇ file doesn't exist„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 then I'm gonna end the if condition„ÄÇ of course„ÄÇ So now in hereÔºå I'm going echo enter„ÄÇText„ÄÇTo search„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå and once I've done thatÔºå I'm going to read it„ÄÇ

 and I'm going store it in a variable name as let's say„ÄÇGrab variable„ÄÇAnd once I've done it„ÄÇ

 now what I'm going to doÔºå I'm going to use some simple G commands„ÄÇ and I'm going to use G„ÄÇ

To actually perform the functionality„ÄÇ So let's say in the file„ÄÇ

 let's say I entered the file name as let's say file grab dot text„ÄÇ and in this file„ÄÇ

I want to search for LinuxÔºå let's sayÔºå OkayÔºå so I write here Linux„ÄÇ

And then I write here the file nameÔºå which is file grab dot textÔºå in fact„ÄÇ

I write here the file raableÔºå which is file Ne„ÄÇInstead of writing Linux here„ÄÇ

With right here the video nameÔºå let's say grab whereÔºå okay„ÄÇSo we save it„ÄÇ We go ahead„ÄÇ

 press control See come out of the„ÄÇProgram the script„ÄÇ and then againÔºå we run our script„ÄÇ

And it says enter file name„ÄÇ So we write here file grab dot textÔºå we hit enter„ÄÇ

 it says enter the text to search we write here Linux„ÄÇ

 So now you can see that it has not shown any result because„ÄÇLÔºå we it is not capital„ÄÇ

 So it is taking it as case sensitiveÔºå okay„ÄÇSo what we want to do is that we can actually write here a flag„ÄÇ

 a negative I to remove the case sensitivity okay„ÄÇSo I press control as I go back„ÄÇ

 I try to run my script„ÄÇAnd I enter the file nameÔºå which is essentially file rep dot text„ÄÇ

 It says enter the text„ÄÇ So I write here Linux now and you can see that it has displayed all the lines which have this thing„ÄÇ

 This is Linux okayÔºå so it has matched the Linux and it has displayed all the lines that contain the word Linux okay„ÄÇ

So there is another thing that we can do is that we can use the line numbers as well So for that we type here negative n so we go back„ÄÇ

 we try to run our script„ÄÇAnd file nameÔºå which is essentially file graph dot text„ÄÇHit enter„ÄÇ

 It says the word that you want to searchÔºå which is essentially„ÄÇLinuxÔºå let's say„ÄÇ

 So you can see that its it gives us the output and it tells us that on these linesÔºå these lines„ÄÇ

 the Linux exists„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so first is number one line„ÄÇ then we have number phoneÔºå4 line number 7„ÄÇ

 number 10Ôºå number 13Ôºå16Ôºå19 and 22„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so in the same way you can search for you know„ÄÇ

 Mac as well or Windows as well„ÄÇ So let's say we want to search for Mac„ÄÇ

So you can see that on these linesÔºå we have Mac„ÄÇ OkayÔºå I hope you've got the point„ÄÇ

So let me clear it„ÄÇSo now there is another thing that you can do is and that is actually you can use the negative C flag or hyphen C flag and let's see what that flag does okay„ÄÇ

So file graph or textÔºå enter the text„ÄÇ Let's say I add Windows„ÄÇAnd you can seeÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 I have not added negative C hereÔºå okay„ÄÇNative sea„ÄÇWe save it„ÄÇWe come hereÔºå we run our script again„ÄÇ

 and we write here the file nameÔºå which is essentially file grab„ÄÇDot text„ÄÇHit enter„ÄÇ

 right here windows„ÄÇYou can see thatÔºå because of that C„ÄÇC flag„ÄÇ

 it has told us that basically Windows this word occurs eight times in our fileÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 so negative C basically gives you the number of times the word has basically existed in the file„ÄÇ

Another thing that you can do is that you can use the negative V flag as well„ÄÇ

 So let's see what this flag does„ÄÇ So if we go back„ÄÇ

 we try to run our script and we write here the file nameÔºå which is essentially„ÄÇFile graph or text„ÄÇ

And hit enter we right here the word windows„ÄÇ you can see that basically it has given us 16„ÄÇ

 So now what this 16 is representing„ÄÇ let's in order to make it clear what we' are going to do that we're going remove this negative C and negative n flag„ÄÇ

We're going to save it„ÄÇre we're going to come back and we're going to run here our script again„ÄÇ

File graph dot text„ÄÇWindows„ÄÇNow you can see that basically it is showing all the lines which are without„ÄÇ

Without that Windows word okayÔºå so with that thing when we were having negative I in negative n and negative C in that case„ÄÇ

 the negative v was showing the number of lines which were which did not contain„ÄÇüéºTheir word windows„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so the number was 16„ÄÇ OkayÔºå8 line can eight lines have windows„ÄÇ

 and we figured it out by using the flag C„ÄÇA negative C and the number of lines that do not contain the word windows are 16 and we figured it out using the flag negative v Okay so I hope you' have got the point so that's how basically you can use G you can use your own regular expressions that you want to I think we have regular expression video on our channel as well so go ahead and watch that with put the link of that video in the description or in the i button so there are plenty of things that you can do with the Gr command„ÄÇ

 so in order to check that out what you can do is that you can go man G okay so you can go to the main pages and you can see that there are a lot of options for Gr and you can learn a lot of options you can practice them and you can see that what are those results that you have got okay„ÄÇ

So let's move on to the next topic„ÄÇ

![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_56.png)

So our next topic is introduction to AWK So the AWK command„ÄÇ

 basically it is a scripting language which is used for manipulating data and generating reports so today in this topic what we are going do is that we are going run this command inside our batchsh scripting file but the idea is that AWk scripting is a whole different topic and there are you know it has its own different files with the extension of dot AW as we have like in the case of bash we have the files with the extension dot S and in case of AWK scripting we have the files as dot AWK however it can also be used in the batchsh scripting and that's what we are going to do that we are going to use this AWk in the case of bash scripting so the AWK command„ÄÇ

Basically you can say that it is a programming language and it requires no compiling and it allows other users to use variables„ÄÇ

 numeric functionsÔºå string functions and logical operators as well okay so AWK basically you can say it is a utility and it enables the programmer to write tiny but effective programs in the form of statements and those statements basically define text patterns that are to be searched or you know that are to be searched in the document and the action that is to be taken when match is found within that file okay„ÄÇ

So you can say that what can we do with OC so basically three things number one that you can scan a file by line okay number two„ÄÇ

 you can basically split each input line into different fields and we're going to see that how can we do that basically we we do that by dollar123 dollar one stands for field number one2 stands for field number two so on and so forth so there is a fourth additional operation that you can perform and that is basically„ÄÇ

You can perform actions on matched lines Okay so another question that you could ask is what is this useful form that is a very valid question„ÄÇ

 So the idea is that basically AWK it transforms data files and it also produce formatted reports„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_58.png)

If we talk about programming constructsÔºå it gives you a formatted output„ÄÇ

 it gives you the ability to perform arithmatic and string operations„ÄÇ

And it gives you the ability to use conditional statements and loops as well„ÄÇ

So now let's go ahead and let's try to do some sort of example„ÄÇ So we go to our scriptÔºå hello script„ÄÇ

And here we try to runÔºå run a few things„ÄÇ OkayÔºå our batch script„ÄÇ

 So let's just go ahead and let's remove this„ÄÇ And what we can do is that we can basically print a file using AWK„ÄÇ

 So how do we do that„ÄÇ SoÔºå first of allÔºå let me justÔºå you knowÔºå use the previous program„ÄÇ

 So I would right hereÔºå enter file name„ÄÇDo print„ÄÇFrom AW K„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so in hereÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 the real thing that we're gonna perform is in here„ÄÇSo in hereÔºå we write AW K„ÄÇ

 and then we write single codes and inside these single codes we print„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so whatever operation„ÄÇ

 whatever functionality you're going to performÔºå you're going to perform inside these single codes„ÄÇ

 Then we're going to write here the file nameÔºå which is essentially the variable„ÄÇFile name„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so that's it„ÄÇ So we save it„ÄÇ and we go ahead to a terminal and we try to run our script„ÄÇSo„ÄÇ

We hit enter and it says enter file name to print from AWK„ÄÇ So let's say I write here„ÄÇ

 let's say file grab„ÄÇWhileil grab dot text„ÄÇSo I hit enter and you can see that it has printed out all of the things„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so do not confuse yourself with the name file graph„ÄÇ is it's just a name„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so it doesn't it it doesn't make it a graph file alright necessarily„ÄÇ

 So let me change the name so that you don't get confused so I'll name it as let's say„ÄÇAWK„ÄÇF„ÄÇO„ÄÇ

So now what we can doÔºå we can also basically print the lines which contain„ÄÇYou knowÔºå theÔºå the word„ÄÇ

 basically a specific word„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so what we can do is that we can actually take another input„ÄÇOr„ÄÇ

You can simplyÔºå you knowÔºå just go here„ÄÇAnd you can write for slash for slash and inside of this for slash„ÄÇ

 you can write hereÔºå let's say we write Linux„ÄÇSo now what this program is going to do it is going to print out which is going to display all the lines in the file„ÄÇ

 which contain this wordÔºå which is essentially„ÄÇLux„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇSo„ÄÇInside our script„ÄÇ

 inside the hello script„ÄÇWe're going write here„ÄÇ Let's say we write here windows„ÄÇWindowsÔºå okay„ÄÇ

So we save itÔºå and we go ahead„ÄÇAnd we try to run our script„ÄÇ Basically„ÄÇ

 I think we have closed our terminal by mistake„ÄÇSo we go to our desktop„ÄÇAnd we run our script„ÄÇ

It says En file Li to print from AWK„ÄÇSo we write here the file nameÔºå which is AWk file dot text„ÄÇ



![](img/b36a14ee7e78eac8551d79c8c2f65846_60.png)

Hit enter any agency that basically it has printed out on the lines only containing„ÄÇWindowsÔºå okay„ÄÇ

Look at that„ÄÇSo there is another thing that you can do„ÄÇ

 You can actually the thing that I was talking about dollar $12„ÄÇ

 you can actually print out specific fields OkayÔºå so let's say„ÄÇ

Let me just go ahead and let's remove all of the lines from here and just keep the three lines„ÄÇ

 And we add another fourth field as well„ÄÇ So let's say we right here„ÄÇ This is Linux 2000„ÄÇ

 This is Windows„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇThis is Windows 3000„ÄÇAnd this is Mac 4000„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 now let me just copy and paste it„ÄÇAnd let me save it„ÄÇ

 So now let's go ahead and let's try to do that„ÄÇSo if we go ahead and if we try to write your brand and then we write here„ÄÇ

 let's say dollar2„ÄÇIt would print out the second fieldÔºå okay„ÄÇAnd we go to our terminal„ÄÇ

And we try to run our script„ÄÇAnd it says enter the file nameÔºå we write here AWK file dot text„ÄÇ

Hit enter„ÄÇ and you can see that basicallyÔºå it has printeded out„ÄÇIs okay„ÄÇSo basically„ÄÇ

It has a search for WindowsÔºå the line which contains windows and from that line it has basically printed out only this one is okay so if you want to print out the fourth field then youd write here 14 okay so we go ahead in the program and we write here instead of $ dollar2 we can write here at 14 if we save it we go back„ÄÇ

And we try to run our script„ÄÇEnter file nameÔºå which is a WK file or text we enter and you can see that it is printing out the number okay the the fourth field that we have here„ÄÇ

 which is this one okay„ÄÇAnd it is displaying it for all windows„ÄÇ

 So there is another thing that you can do„ÄÇ and that is basicallyÔºå you can go here„ÄÇLet me just„ÄÇ

Go inside the file„ÄÇO„ÄÇI think it's opened already„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

So you can actually print out two fields or three fields simultaneously as well„ÄÇ SoÔºå for example„ÄÇ

 if I want to print out the field one„ÄÇOr the field 3„ÄÇLet me just change it toÔºå let's sayÔºå Linux„ÄÇO„ÄÇ

 so„ÄÇIf I save this„ÄÇAnd if I go ahead„ÄÇAnd if I try to run my script„ÄÇAWK file do text„ÄÇ

You can see that basically it is printing out Linux Linux 2000Ôºå Linux 2000„ÄÇ

 Linux 2000 okay so that's how basically you roll okay that's how you're going to work with the AWK command so we have seen some basic use of it maybe were going to create an advanced course on it in the future you can basically create separate files for AWK in which you can write it using begin and end clauses and you can also go to terminal and you can basically check the man pages of AWK for further instructions so I think that's it from this topic so now let's move on to the next topic which is introduction to said„ÄÇ

So set basically stands for a stream editor and you can use it to manipulate text files and substituting purposes as well so the idea is that it can be used in a lot of different ways with a lot of complex files we're going to see a very basic use of it in this course Okay so let's go ahead and let's try to let me just close this file„ÄÇ

And let's go to our script and let's see how we can actually run it„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so what we're going to do is that we're going to keep the„ÄÇProgram the script same„ÄÇ

 let's just do a little bit change here enter file name to let's say substitute„ÄÇ

 let's say we try to substitute first„ÄÇSo entry file name to print„ÄÇOr entry file name to substitute„ÄÇ

Using„ÄÇSaid okayÔºå so now what we're going to do is that first of all„ÄÇ

 let's go ahead and let's see what is in our file„ÄÇ So let me change the name of this file„ÄÇSet file„ÄÇO„ÄÇ

SoÔºå we hit enter„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇWe go inside this file and you can see that this file contains all of that stuff„ÄÇ

SoÔºå what we can do is that„ÄÇWe can go back„ÄÇLet me just close this file as well„ÄÇ

So we can go back here and we can actually start making changes using pipes okay so let's say we write here CA and then we write here the file name which is essentially set file dot text„ÄÇ

And then we write here a pipe signÔºå okay„ÄÇAnd then after thatÔºå we write here set„ÄÇ

 which is a set command that we're going to use„ÄÇAnd then we would put where„ÄÇ

And then we put double codes„ÄÇ and then we write hereÔºå4 slashÔºå4 slashÔºå4 slash„ÄÇAnd obviously„ÄÇ

 then we're going to write here in the beginningÔºå we're going to write here S„ÄÇ

 which represent the substitutionÔºå and then we're going to write here„ÄÇ

 let's say if we go back to this fileÔºå let's say we want to substitute I and we want to replace it with capital I okay„ÄÇ

Here„ÄÇAs well„ÄÇ So what we're going to do is that we're going to write here inside the script„ÄÇSmall I„ÄÇ

 because this is the one which already exists„ÄÇ And then we're going to write here capital I„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 because this is the thing that we want to„ÄÇReplace okayÔºå and we're going to write here control„ÄÇ

 we're going to controlÔºå save it and we're going to go back and we'll try to run our script and let's see what happens„ÄÇ

So it says entry file name to substitute using set„ÄÇ So you right here set„ÄÇF„ÄÇDot text„ÄÇ

 And we hit enter„ÄÇAnd basicallyÔºå you can see it has changed„ÄÇActually„ÄÇ

 I'm going to make the size of the file smaller so that you can actually view this thing very clearly„ÄÇ

So I'm going to controlÔºå save itÔºå I'm going to come back„ÄÇ

And I'm going to run my script again so that you can see the change very clearly„ÄÇ

 so we're right here„ÄÇAnd we put in the file nameÔºå which is said file dot text for hit enter and you can see that basically our program has worked„ÄÇ

 our script has worked„ÄÇ So if we go back to our script„ÄÇ

We wanted to replace small I with the capital I„ÄÇ So what has happened is that„ÄÇThis small letter I„ÄÇ

 the first one has been replaced with replaced with capital I okay but you can see the second one and the third ones„ÄÇ

 they are like the same so in order to do that if you want to replace all of the eyes what you have to do is that you have to go back to your script„ÄÇ

And you just have to write here GÔºå okay„ÄÇWhich stands for Global another thing that you would notice that„ÄÇ

 you know using pipe is just a conventionÔºå so even if you don't use it„ÄÇIt would still workÔºå okayÔºü

So normallyÔºå I don't use itÔºå but it'sÔºå it's just a convention„ÄÇ

 So we're gonna write here the file nameÔºå which is„ÄÇFi name„ÄÇO„ÄÇAnd we save it„ÄÇ

And then what we are going to do is„ÄÇThat we're going to go back„ÄÇAnd we're going run it„ÄÇ

So now notice that we have added GÔºå which stands for global and now it is going to replace all the I in the file with the capital I so we run our strip„ÄÇ

And we given the file nameÔºå which is set file ort text„ÄÇ

And you can see it has replaced all the eyes with the capitalise„ÄÇ

I hope you have got the point so what you can do is now if you notice that these are the changes which have not been made inside the file Okay„ÄÇ

 so if you open up your file you can see that all these letters are small right so this change is„ÄÇ

Has not been made inside the file rather it is just simply an output okay so what you can do is that you can also make changes to the file you can modify the file but what's usually I do that when when you know I'm working with the complex files or even when you are working with the complex file what youve got to do is that it is good that if you create the backup so you can do what you can do is that you can just simply go to your script hello script dot S and just simply write here any other file name„ÄÇ

 create a new fileÔºå new file dot text so what's going to happen that basically it is going to copy this thing into that new file if I run my script again„ÄÇ

And if I write here side sit file do text„ÄÇAnd you can see that now it has not given any output what it has done„ÄÇ

 it has created a new fileÔºå and in this fileÔºå we have redirected the output and this file contains the output„ÄÇ

 So now you can say that what if I want to modify the fileÔºå which is already there„ÄÇ

So you can do that in two fundamental waysÔºå you can redirect the file you know redirect this thing directly to the file as well or what you can do is that you can go here„ÄÇ

And you can use a flag„ÄÇAnd that would be negative I„ÄÇ

 So make sure that when you do this thing negative I„ÄÇ

 you really want to do it because it is going to modify your file forever and there is no going back„ÄÇ

 You cannot undo that okay so„ÄÇAfter doing it„ÄÇWhat what you're going to have„ÄÇ

 you're going to have that new thing that you're trying to haveÔºå okayÔºü

So let's go ahead and let's try to save it and let's try to run it„ÄÇAnd let's see what happens„ÄÇ

 So it says enter file name substitute using said„ÄÇ So we enter here the file name„ÄÇ

 which is essentially said„ÄÇFile or textÔºå we hit enter and you will see that it has not given any output„ÄÇ

 what has happened that if we go back to that file and you will see that changes have been made„ÄÇ

Alright in that set file as well„ÄÇ So there is another thing that you can do and that is basically you can replace whole words as well„ÄÇ

 So right now what we have done we have replaced you knowÔºå I think„ÄÇ

We have replaced only one single alphabet„ÄÇ so you can replace complete words even„ÄÇ

 So let's say we won't replace Linux„ÄÇWith let's say UniÔºå Okay„ÄÇ

 so if we save it and if we go back and if we try to run our scriptÔºå let's see what happens„ÄÇ

So enter files name file name„ÄÇ So we write here set file ort textÔºå we hit enter„ÄÇ

 and if we now go back to our set file„ÄÇYou can see that it has not replaced it because the eye is capital Okay„ÄÇ

 so make sure that you take care of the case sensitivity or you use any flag which actually care take care of the sensitivity as well So we write here Linux Okay this way So we save it we go ahead„ÄÇ

 we try to run our script„ÄÇThe file nameÔºå which is set file dot text„ÄÇWe hit enter„ÄÇAnd if we reload„ÄÇ

 you can see that Linux has been replaced with„ÄÇUnixÔºå okayÔºå you can replace the whole strings„ÄÇ

 So let's say I want to replace 2002000Ôºå and you want to replace it with 8000„ÄÇ Let's say we save it„ÄÇ

 We try to run our script again„ÄÇSet file the text„ÄÇAnd nowÔºå if we go to our set file reload„ÄÇ

 you can see that 8000 has been replaced by„ÄÇSorryÔºå 2000 has been replaced by 8000Ôºå okay„ÄÇ

So I hope you've got the point you have learned this said command for further things you can learn„ÄÇ

 you can manage itÔºå you can see what what are those things„ÄÇ

 what are other things that you can do with said as well okay so now let's move on to the next topic„ÄÇ

Which isÔºå essentially„ÄÇTheybu in a ba script„ÄÇSo the idea is that bash offers an extensive debugging facility so you can actually debug your bash script and you know if something doesn't go according to the plan then you can actually take a look at it and you know that this is the thing which is happening So right now we have this hello script so let's say that we intentionally create some sort of like error„ÄÇ

 So if we remove the spaceÔºå you know everybody knows that obviously it is going to give some sort of error right So we run our script and we give some name let's say set file dot text„ÄÇ

That was the program that we were running before right so you can see that it has given an error right so right now it is pretty clear that where the error is that we know the error is in the if lock right on the line6 but in some cases when you are having long scripts like  a thousand0 line or 2000 line scripts then most of the time it is hard to identify if there are multiple errors okay so for that what you can do you can debug your script and you can know that what's happening on each and every step okay so there are basically three fundamental ways in which you can debug your script„ÄÇ

So the first way is that you basically run your script„ÄÇLike this„ÄÇIn fact„ÄÇ

 before writing before running your scriptÔºå let me just clear it first„ÄÇ Before running your script„ÄÇ

 you write here batchshÔºå then you write here negative x„ÄÇ and then„ÄÇU right hereÔºå the script name„ÄÇ

 OkayÔºå so now what this batchsh negative x is going to doÔºå it is going to debug your script„ÄÇSo„ÄÇ

 we hit enter„ÄÇAnd you can see that basically it is showing step by step that which are those steps which are being executed„ÄÇ

 So the first step which has been executed is this one„ÄÇ

The echo command and then the step which has been executed is the read command„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ

 so now we' right here the nameÔºå which is essentially set file„ÄÇ

The text so you can see that it shows that this line has been executed and this line has been executed Okay so it basically shows you step by step which lines are being executed so let's say if if if we would have a follow loop here then it would be showing like the iterations of the for loop like this is the first iteration it would be showing the number and then it would be showing the code that is been executed inside the for loop then it would be showing the second iteration with number two and then it would be showing the same code that is being executed right so that's how it shows you step by step procedure So there is another way to do the same thing you can basically put negative x here and now your script with debug as well so let's say we go ahead and we just try to simply run our script and you can see that our script is debugging in in the same way right so we write here set file or text and„ÄÇ

We see that it is giving us the same results and it is telling us that which lines are being executed„ÄÇ

So there is a third and final way you can basically select like from what point to what point you want your script to run„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå so for exampleÔºå let's say I want my script to start debugging here and I want my script to let's say stop debugging here„ÄÇ

So„ÄÇThe idea is that from the point where you from where you're starting you have to put set negative x there and at specific point where you want to stop you have to put set plus X Okay I hope you have got the point so that's how you basically you debug your script from one point to another point so let's go ahead and let's save it let's see what happens now So if we run our script like this you can see that it has debugged first two lines and let's see what happens next So if we put if we put in the file name which is set file dot text we hit enter and you can see that basically it has not shown anything like this„ÄÇ

It has shown plus x set plus xÔºå OkayÔºå so it means that basically the debugging ends here„ÄÇ

 So debugging was starting from here„ÄÇAnd it ends hereÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 so it would print out set plus sex as wellÔºå okay„ÄÇSo I hope you have got the point„ÄÇ

 That's how basically you debug a bass script„ÄÇ So these are the three fundamental different ways to debug in a script„ÄÇ

 They are quiteÔºå you can also go on and you can now also test the this debugging on other programs„ÄÇ

 other scripts as wellÔºå for exampleÔºå in the case of while loops and fall loops„ÄÇ

 it would work the same okay„ÄÇ
