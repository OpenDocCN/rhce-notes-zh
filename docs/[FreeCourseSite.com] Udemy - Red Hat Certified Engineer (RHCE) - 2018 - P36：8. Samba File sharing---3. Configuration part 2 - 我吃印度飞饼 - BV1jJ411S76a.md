So all Smba is installed on this machineÔºå but I want to go ahead and install Smba client and Smba Common also these are two files„ÄÇ

 just like anything else on Sanos 7„ÄÇOnce we install a serviceÔºå we have to enable it„ÄÇ

And so after installing the SAmba packageÔºå you have to enable SAMba services to be allowed through system firewall„ÄÇ

With these commands„ÄÇ So we're gonna to use firewall„ÄÇÊâì cmd„ÄÇDashÔºå dashÔºå permanent„ÄÇDashÔºå dash„ÄÇZone„ÄÇ

 now we're going to configure some anonymous file sharing„ÄÇ And order to do that„ÄÇ

 we have to create the directory first„ÄÇ So M K du„ÄÇDash P„ÄÇSÔºå RÔºå S RV„ÄÇSumber„ÄÇAnonymous„ÄÇ

And then we have to change the permission on that C mod„ÄÇDash R„ÄÇAnd we'll change it to 0Ôºå7Ôºå75„ÄÇSlash„ÄÇS„ÄÇ

 we can open the Sbar configuration file for editing where we can to modify or add the sections„ÄÇ

With the corresponding directives„ÄÇHere let's edit the file„ÄÇ‰∏Ä see„ÄÇSomeÔºå but actually„ÄÇ

 we are in that directory„ÄÇ So if I do a„ÄÇVim„ÄÇOf„ÄÇS and B„ÄÇDot com„ÄÇAnd the global„ÄÇ

We're going change the word group to let's just call it word group„ÄÇOkayÔºå were group next„ÄÇ

We're going to say no to that„ÄÇAnd force user equals nobody„ÄÇFourth„ÄÇUser„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇNobody„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

And then we're going to delete some of these„ÄÇHere„ÄÇüòîÔºåYou like the comment„ÄÇ

 the section of this one right here„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇThis one here„ÄÇWe are dealing with printersÔºå in our example„ÄÇ

Okay„ÄÇAnd we're going to leave the rest as it is„ÄÇAnd I'm going to save it and exit„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 so after we have saved the file we have exitedÔºå then we're going to run this command called Te„ÄÇParm„ÄÇ

 which is text„ÄÇThe testing parameter„ÄÇ That's what you're doing„ÄÇAnd as you can see„ÄÇ

 everything is tested out fineÔºå says loaded services file okay„ÄÇ
