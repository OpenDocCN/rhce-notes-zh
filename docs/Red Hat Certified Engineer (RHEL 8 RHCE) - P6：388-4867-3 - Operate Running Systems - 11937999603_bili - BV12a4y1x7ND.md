# Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHEL 8 RHCE) - P6ï¼š388-4867-3 - Operate Running Systems - 11937999603_bili - BV12a4y1x7ND

Welcome back everyoneï¼Œ this is Mattï¼Œ and in this video we're going to talk about operating running systemsã€‚

 and this is going to continue the section on basic Red Ha certified administrator skillsã€‚



![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_1.png)

So let's go ahead and click on section 2 and then operate running systemsã€‚

So the first thing that we need to talk about is shutting down and rebooting systemsã€‚

 and if you've worked in IT at all or even just own your own personal computerã€‚

 it's pretty common knowledge that it's important to shut down or reboot your system normally rather than just pulling out the plug or flipping a switch off because that can cause issues with certain running processesã€‚

So to turn a system offï¼Œ you can just type in system CTtl power off or if you'd like to reboot itã€‚

 you can do system CTtl reboot for more infoï¼Œ you can always type system CTtlhelp or manned system CTl just to see what your different options areã€‚

 but that is pretty much the basics when it comes down to shutting down or rebooting a serverã€‚

 Keep in mind that you will need to use pseudo or assume root before you can run these commandsã€‚

 And I wanted to make a quick note about previous versions of Red Haã€‚

 so in times past you would just run power off or reboot so you wouldn't add that system CTl prefixã€‚

 but now that we have system CTlï¼Œ it should be added before running the commandã€‚

The next topic is to interrupt the boot process in order to change the root password to gain access to a systemã€‚

This is very important because there are times that you will need to gain access to a system that you're shut out ofã€‚

 And as we said when we were talking about S S Hï¼Œ you can't administer a system that you don't have access toã€‚

 So firstï¼Œ you need to edit the kernel boot parameters by pressing Eã€‚

 So when the screen first loads upï¼Œ you'll see the list ofã€‚Ctrol Eï¼Œ so that'll move you to the nã€‚

 and then you can remove RO crash and then add R D dot break and then enforcing equals 0ã€‚

 and then you can start up the system by pressing control Xã€‚Once you're on the command lineã€‚

 you need to remount the root of the systemï¼Œ and this is done by typing in mount dash O and then provide the options of remount and readWriteã€‚

And that's going to be on the Cissro directoryã€‚Once the directory has been remountedã€‚

 you can switch to that directory using C H root or trootã€‚

 which will then allow you to interact with it as a special route directoryã€‚

 So once you're in that directoryï¼Œ you can reset the root password by simply doing pass WDã€‚

 Once that's completedï¼Œ you have reset the passwordï¼Œ which was your goalã€‚

 So now you just need to enable Se X relabeling by creating the dot auto relabel fileã€‚ Finallyã€‚

 you can exit out of the shellã€‚ All rightï¼Œ So now let's head to the next pageã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And then we can head over the command line in order to work with these servicesã€‚

So prior to this videoï¼Œ I already installed the HTTPD serverã€‚

 so let's go ahead and check on the status of thatã€‚ I'm going to run pseudo system CTLã€‚Statusã€‚HttPDã€‚

But type an incorrectã€‚Now you can add the dot service hereï¼Œ but if you leave it blankã€‚

 then the command is going to assume the dot serviceï¼Œ so I'll go ahead and leave it blankã€‚

It'll enter in our passwordã€‚And we see that the service is loadedï¼Œ but it's currently inactiveã€‚

 so let's go ahead and clear our screen hereï¼Œ and then we can start up the serviceã€‚

Now before we do thatï¼Œ I'm just going to go ahead and switch to the root user since we're going to be doing some privilege commandsã€‚

So we'll do that with Cash Iã€‚And I'll clear that outã€‚So let's go ahead and start up HttPDã€‚

 We'll type in system CTLï¼Œ start HttPDã€‚All rightï¼Œ and now we can run our status againã€‚

And we see that our service is now active and running with cu to quitã€‚

And then if we want to shut down the service or stop itã€‚We can do system CTLï¼Œ stopã€‚

 and then again the name of the serviceã€‚And then if we run our status againã€‚

We can see that the service has stoppedã€‚So now let's go ahead and gain a little bit more informationã€‚

And we're going to do that using journal CTLï¼Œ and we're also going to add the dash X and dash E flagsã€‚

So adding dash X is going to add explanatory text from the message catalog and then E is going to take you directly to the end of the catalogã€‚

 So if you're working on something currently and you're having issues with itã€‚

 that information is most likely going to be at the end of the catalogã€‚

 So let's go ahead and type in journal CTl and then dash X Eã€‚

 So as you can see it puts us into a text viewerã€‚And if we scroll up hereï¼Œ we seeã€‚

When we issued the command for our HTTPD service to shut downã€‚

gives us a little information about thatã€‚If you continue to scroll upã€‚

 you're going to see more information we'll probably see when we start up there it isã€‚

 but this is a really good place to go if you're troubleshooting issues with a service or you just need to gain a little bit more informationã€‚

So let's go ahead and hit Q to quitï¼Œ and then we'll clear our screenã€‚And before we move onã€‚

 let's go ahead and start up this service againã€‚ and then we're going to enable itã€‚

 So in order to start itï¼Œ it's going to be system CTtL start as we knowã€‚



![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_3.png)

So let's go ahead and do the status on that so it's startedã€‚

 and then we can go ahead and run our enableã€‚And you see that when we enable this serviceã€‚

 it's going to create a sim link here in Etsy system D system multi user target wantsã€‚

It's going to point to this userlib system D system HTTBD serviceã€‚

And you can always just copy this right hereã€‚

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_5.png)

I'll just do a listingã€‚And you can see all the similarlinks that have been created by system Dã€‚

We want toï¼Œ we can list out our one for HtTBDã€‚And we see that it's thereã€‚And thenï¼Œ if weã€‚

Run a disableã€‚We see that the simlink has been removedã€‚ so if we try to list that out againã€‚

Says no such file or directoryã€‚Alrightï¼Œ so let's go ahead and reenable that and then we can clear our screen All right so the next thing we want to talk about is viewing processes and resource utilization and I feel like I keep saying that everything's important and you need to know it and in a lot of ways that's trueã€‚

 but this is a very important thing for for at least troubleshooting issues on your host if you're having problems with resource utilization and tracking down what process is causing that this is a very fundamental skill that you need to have So let's go ahead and just print out a list of the active processes and we can do this with PS dash EFã€‚

You can also use PSOXã€‚And as you can seeï¼Œ this is just going to print out a ton of different running processesã€‚

 And so when we use dash Eï¼Œ that's just basically saying list all the processesã€‚

 and then dash F is going to do a full format list So it's going to give us some extra columns of informationã€‚

 So let's go ahead and clear thisã€‚So knowing how to print all the processes is goodã€‚

 but it's also important to be able to pipe that information into something like GrP so you can actually make use of itã€‚

And so we're just going to go ahead and do PS dashfã€‚

 and then we're going to grab for the user Apacheã€‚And it's going to show us all the processes that are running as that userã€‚

 which is going to be running our HtTBD serverï¼Œ But keep in mind that this is just kind of a quick snapshot of what's running at that momentã€‚

 But if you want a real time or at least a more real timeï¼Œ I think top is updated every two secondsã€‚

 we can use the top commandã€‚ So let's go ahead and run thatã€‚



![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_7.png)

And so every couple of secondsï¼Œ this process listing is going to update so it's going to show you which processes are runningã€‚

 what's consuming the most CPU in memoryã€‚It's also going to let you know about your load average and the total number of processes that are runningã€‚

 So there's just a lot of good information here that gets dynamically updatedã€‚

 There's also some different ways you can filter using top so for instanceã€‚

 I could just type in you and search for a particular userã€‚ So I want to look for the Apache userã€‚

 So it's just going to show nothing but the Apache userã€‚



![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_9.png)

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_10.png)

Then I'll go ahead and quit out of that and just very quicklyã€‚

 I just wanted to show you top one more time we can also type in H for help and so this is going to show you some of the things you can do to filter or view top in a way that is most fitting to you and what you needã€‚



![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_12.png)

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_13.png)

So I'm going to go ahead and quit out of this and on a control Cã€‚And then we can clear our screenã€‚



![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_15.png)

And so next we want to talk about terminating a running processã€‚ So againã€‚

 this is really important if you need to kill a process that's not shutting down normallyã€‚

 or if you just have a certain road Piï¼Œ you need to kill we're going to do that with as you guessed itã€‚

 the kill commandã€‚ So if you want to get a listing of the different signals that you can useã€‚

 you can just type in kill Lã€‚

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_17.png)

And it's going to show you a list of all the different signals you can doã€‚Typically speakingã€‚

 there's two that most people are going to end up usingsingã€‚ And that is kill D 15 or kill 9ã€‚

 And that's going to be sick term and then sick killã€‚

 So sick term is going to try to let the process terminate normally of its own accordã€‚

But if for some reason that's not working that's typically what you want to use just to prevent any problems from happeningã€‚

 but if that does not workï¼Œ then you can use the kill 9 or kill dashash9ã€‚

 and that's going to send the sick killï¼Œ which is just going to terminate the process immediatelyã€‚

 no questions askedã€‚

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_19.png)

So if we do another listing real quickã€‚Just gripep for Apacheã€‚And as you can seeã€‚

 the first column is going to be the username and keep in mind there is a little bit of a wrap hereã€‚

 so don't get confused by thatã€‚ Each one of these is a new lineã€‚

 and that's going to be followed by the process ID as well as the parent process IDã€‚

So let's go ahead and just kill the process ID of this 3299 real quickã€‚

And I'm just going to use the kill Dash 15ã€‚ Actuallyï¼Œ let's go ahead and do 9ã€‚

 Let's just get aggressive on itã€‚And then we're going to specify the PIdï¼Œ which is 3299ã€‚Boomã€‚

 all rightï¼Œ so now let's go ahead and run our listing againã€‚

And we see that the process ID of 3299 its no longer runningã€‚But in factã€‚

 another process was started upï¼Œ and that is because this parent processï¼Œ3295 is runningã€‚

 So if we want to kill the child processesï¼Œ we need to kill the parent processã€‚

 So let's go ahead and kill that P Pã€‚This time we're going to use the dash 15 because we want it to shut down a little more normally this timeã€‚

 so it's going to be 32 95ã€‚Alrightï¼Œ let's see if it's shut down yetã€‚

And we see that it shut down successfullyã€‚

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_21.png)

Okayï¼Œ so let's go ahead and clear our screen outï¼Œ and then we can move on to the last topicã€‚

 which is going to be copying files between remote systemsã€‚

And the first thing that we want to talk about is secure copy or SCPã€‚

 And this is going to be kind of your bread and butter for copying remote filesã€‚

 It's super quick and easyï¼Œ uses the SSH protocolï¼Œ So it's secureã€‚

 and you can also use the dash R option in order to recursively copy files and directoriesã€‚

 So right now I'm in roots home directoryã€‚PWã€‚And we have a couple files hereã€‚

 but I'm going to go ahead and touch just SCP test fileï¼Œ so what we're going to call itã€‚

And we we have it in hereï¼Œ and I'm going to copy that to my MS Pearson 1 C server hereã€‚

 Let's go ahead and get the I addressã€‚

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_23.png)

All rightã€‚Let go ahead and do the private addressã€‚

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_25.png)

And then clear this outã€‚ and then we can SCPï¼Œ and it's going to be SCP test as the fileã€‚

 And I'm going to do this as the cloud userã€‚And it's going to go to MSParson 1cã€‚We copypy itã€‚

 and let's just go ahead and put it in the temp directoryã€‚ So I'll go ahead and hit enter hereã€‚

I'll accept thisï¼Œ then I need to give my password for the cloud userã€‚ And as you can seeã€‚

 the file copiedã€‚But just to validate thatï¼Œ let's go ahead and head back over to our second hostã€‚



![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_27.png)

![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_28.png)

Clear this outï¼Œ and then I'll just do a listing on our temp directoryã€‚

And we see right there at the topï¼Œ we have SCP testã€‚

So the next thing I want to talk about is FTP and secure FTPã€‚

 I would definitely recommend using secure FTP over FTP because FTP does not encrypt your data by defaultã€‚

 but in order to use SFTPï¼Œ you just type in SFTP and then the username and then the server that you would like to copy to let's go ahead and clear thisã€‚



![](img/12cb73b8325c1a419538e71c9514a66f_30.png)

We'll go back to our original serverï¼Œ and I'm just going to type in SFTP and then cloud user atã€‚

Our IP address need to give the passwordã€‚And as you can seeï¼Œ it's put me into this SFTP promptã€‚

And you'll notice this desktopsï¼Œ documentsï¼Œ downloadsï¼Œ all these directories that are underã€‚

 this is actually under the cloud user's home directoryã€‚

And so the difference between LS and LLS is LS is just going to do a listing on the server that you've connected to and then LLS is going to do a local listingã€‚

 So as you can see it's got my I'm in my root directory with the Anaconda Ksã€‚

 CFfg in ourP test file so you can see that I'm able to view files on bothã€‚

 So let's go ahead and run a putã€‚And then SCP testã€‚As you can seeï¼Œ it's uploading SCP testã€‚

m not sure how said that beforeï¼Œ but SCP test to home cloud user and then of course the name of the fileã€‚

 and then we can do our remote listing by doing LS and we see our file and that pretty much sums up SFTPã€‚

 of course there are many other options you can use but feel free to look at the man pages on that to gain a little bit more information but that's going to finish up this lesson on operate running systemsã€‚

 so let's go ahead and market Comp and we can move on to the next sectionã€‚
