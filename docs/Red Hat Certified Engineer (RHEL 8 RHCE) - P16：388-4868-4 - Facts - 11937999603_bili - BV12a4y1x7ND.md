Welcome back everyoneï¼Œ this is Mattï¼Œ and in this video we're going to be talking about a very important part of Ansible and that is Ansible factsã€‚

So let's go ahead and click on understanding core components of Ansible and then head down to the section on factsã€‚



![](img/e93e8351f9052e4e20a2903d178b229c_1.png)

So firstï¼Œ facts are going to provide certain information about a given target hostã€‚

Facts are basically variables that Ansible is going to fill in for you as it reaches out to a host in order to gather informationã€‚

It's going to show IP addressesï¼Œ host namesï¼Œ operating systemsï¼Œ and even kernelsã€‚

These facts can then be used to implement conditional execution of tasksã€‚

 meaning that you can configure Ansible to run certain tasksã€‚

 depending on the information that is gathered about a hostã€‚

 And this could be a situation where you only want certain packages or package managers to be runã€‚

 depending on the operating system of the hostï¼Œ or even if you only want to perform certain task based on a given host nameã€‚

But you can also use fax just to get ad hoc information about your systemã€‚

 So in order to see all the facts for a hostï¼Œ all you need to do is run ansible using the setup moduleã€‚

 And I've actually provide an example of this belowã€‚ So by defaultã€‚

 the setup module is going to pull back all the facts of the target hostã€‚

 all the ones that ansible has access toï¼Œ but you can also restrict or filter the information either by passing arguments to the setup moduleã€‚

 such as specifying the network subset or specifying minã€‚

 which is going to pull back less informationï¼Œ or you can always pipe the output in a grip to search for specific variablesã€‚

Nextï¼Œ facts are automatically discovered by Ansible when it reaches out to a hostã€‚

 but facts can be disabledã€‚So the default behavior of Ansible is that whenever it reaches out a host to perform an actionã€‚

 it's going to collect these factsã€‚ But you are able to disable this in the configurationã€‚

 gatheringing facts about a host doesï¼Œ of courseï¼Œ take resourcesã€‚

 So there is a little bit of a performance hit that takes place any time you're gathering those factsã€‚

 So you may find a situation where you would rather disable fact gathering in order to save on resourcesã€‚

 And this can be specifically true if you're dealing with a large number of hostsã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

But in most situationsï¼Œ you're not going to need to disable fact gatheringã€‚

 but it's a good idea to know that you do have the optionã€‚

 And this actually leads into the next pointï¼Œ which is facts can be cached for use in playbook executionã€‚

 So if you're in a situation where you're caching ansible factsã€‚

 you may want to disable the gathering so that whenever you're referencing variablesã€‚

 you're actually using the facts that have been cached rather than facts that you're pulling in each time you run the playbookã€‚

 Andï¼Œ of courseï¼Œ that is going to save you on time as wellã€‚

 And I did want to mention that it is possible for one server to reference the variables about another serverã€‚

 and this can happen in one of two different waysã€‚The first is with fat caching disã€‚

 So the host that you want to interact with using the variables gathered by facts must have been talked to by Ansible in the current play or another play that was referenced higher up in the play bookã€‚

 So if facts were not gathered about that host during this playbook executionã€‚

 you cannot reference the variablesã€‚ Nowï¼Œ if you have fat caching enabledï¼Œ which is the second wayã€‚

 you do not have to gather facts about the host in the current playbookã€‚

 The play will simply reference the variables that have been previously stored in the fact cacheã€‚

And ultimately the decision on whether or not to cache your ansible f is going to depend on your particular situation and your particular installationã€‚

 but just keep in mindï¼Œ you cannot reference variables about another host unless of courseã€‚

 you've gathered those facts higher up in the playbook or unless you're taking advantage of fact cachingã€‚

Wellï¼Œ that's going to finish up this video on Ans factsã€‚

 so let's go ahead and market Comp and we can move on to the next lessonã€‚
