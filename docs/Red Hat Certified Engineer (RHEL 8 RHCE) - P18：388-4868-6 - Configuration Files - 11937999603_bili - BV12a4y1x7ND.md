Welcome back everyoneï¼Œ this is Mattï¼Œ and in this video we are going to finish up our section on understanding the core components of Ansible by talking about the ansible configuration filesã€‚



![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_1.png)

So let's head over to section  threeã€‚And then down to configuration filesã€‚

So first we're going to talk about the ansible configuration file itselfã€‚

And so there are a few different possible locations of the Ansible configuration fileã€‚

 and I have placed them here in the diagram in the order that they are processedã€‚

 First is ansible underscore configï¼Œ which is an environment variable that you can setã€‚

 This is not set by defaultã€‚ But if you define this variable and point it to an actual ansible configuration fileã€‚

 then that is the one that will be usedã€‚Next is the ansible do CFfG in the current directoryã€‚

 so that is your current working directoryã€‚ So for me right now I'm in the home cloud user directoryã€‚

 but I could go to Ansible and if I had an ansible do CFfG in hereã€‚

 and the environment variable was not setï¼Œ then this is the ansible dot CFfG that would get picked up and usedã€‚

Next is dotansibleã€‚cfg in the user's home directoryï¼Œ so if we went back to my actual home directoryã€‚

And we can see that I currently do not have a dot Answã€‚ cfg configuration file in my home directoryã€‚

 but if I did and the previous two were not foundï¼Œ then it would use this configurationã€‚

And then lastlyï¼Œ if it goes through all three of those and does not find a configuration fileã€‚

 it's going to default to Etsyansible ansibleã€‚cfgï¼Œ and this is the default master configuration file for Ansibleã€‚

And just to reiterateï¼Œ whenever Ansible finds a configuration file in one of these locationsã€‚

 of course in the order processï¼Œ it's going to stop looking for configuration filesã€‚All rightã€‚

 so moving on from locationsï¼Œ a configuration file will not automatically load if it is in a worldriable directoryã€‚

 So this is something that's important to note that even if you have an ansible do Cfg in your current directoryã€‚

 If that is worldriableï¼Œ It's not going to automatically load itã€‚

 And this is to prevent the security threat that would be introduced from someone else being able to put their own configurations for malicious purposesã€‚

 So this is one of those security measures that Ansible puts in place in order to save us from ourselvesã€‚

Next configuration can be set in environment variablesã€‚So as we already showedã€‚

 you can specify the config file as an environment variableã€‚

 so the actual path of the configuration fileï¼Œ but you can also specify individual configurations as environment variablesã€‚

 so this can be really handy and one- off situations where you need to temporarily override a setting but you don't actually want to permanently change the file and keep in mind that any environment variable that you set for your current session is going to be used by ansible rather than what is set in the ansibleã€‚

 CFfg and that's because Ansible wants to allow you to make those one- off changes for that current session and just keep in mind that once you log out of your shell sessionã€‚

 the variables will go awayã€‚All rightï¼Œ our next section is common Ansible configurationsã€‚

 and first let's talk about the Ansible dashash and Fig command that can be used in order to view configurationsã€‚

And this is honestly a great way to list the different configuration options and their values and can be especially useful if you're trying to find a value that you want to change as a one off environment variableã€‚

 but it' ultimately just handy in letting you know what's availableã€‚

 So the ansible dash configman has some subcomdsã€‚ Firstã€‚

 we have list And this is going to print all the configuration options that are available to you with a description and the defaultã€‚

 So let's go ahead and try that out real quickã€‚ So we're going to run anible dash configã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And then listã€‚

![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_3.png)

And this is going to put you in a little text for and you can scroll up and downã€‚

 but you're also able to searchã€‚ So let's go ahead and just search for inventoryã€‚



![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_5.png)

And here we see the default host list and the default location for that isï¼Œ againã€‚

 Etsy Ansipible hostsã€‚ And it's going to tell you the environment variable nameã€‚

 which is ansible underscore inventoryã€‚ So if you wanted to set that as a one off environment variableã€‚

 you would just specify ansible inventory equals whatever path to your host fileã€‚

 Let's go ahead and back out of thisã€‚

![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_7.png)

And the next subcom we have is Dï¼Œ and this is going to dump the output of the current configurations and their valuesã€‚

 so this can be really handy if you want to know what a certain value is set to currentlyã€‚

Let's go ahead and try that real quickã€‚ and going book figï¼Œ don'ã€‚



![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_9.png)

This is going to put us back into that text viewerã€‚

 and you're going to see the different configurations and their valuesã€‚



![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_11.png)

![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_12.png)

Let's go ahead and search for managedã€‚And then right here we have the default managed stringã€‚

Which is set to ansible managedã€‚ And we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a minuteã€‚

Let's go ahead and back out of hereã€‚And then the last subcomman is going to be viewã€‚

 and this allows you to view the current configuration fileã€‚Let's type in ansible dash configã€‚

And then viewã€‚

![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_14.png)

And this is just going to show us the configuration file that Ansible is currently usingã€‚



![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_16.png)

So againï¼Œ Ansple Dash can f very helpful command when it comes to finding out what ansipple is using and what configurations are currently setã€‚

 So now let's go ahead and talk about some of the commonly used settingsã€‚

 and we've already alluded to someï¼Œ of courseã€‚ but first we have inventoryã€‚

And this is going to specify the default inventory fileã€‚

 So if you'd like to change the default inventory fileã€‚ This is where you'll do itã€‚ Nextã€‚

 we have roles underscore pathï¼Œ and this is going to set paths to search in for ansible rolesã€‚

 And againï¼Œ you can change this location or you can add just additional directories to search inã€‚

 just make sure you separate each by a colonã€‚ Nextï¼Œ we have forksã€‚

 which specifies the amount of hosts that are configured by ansible at the same timeã€‚

 And this is alluding to parallelismï¼Œ which we'll talk about a little bit more later onã€‚

 but basicallyï¼Œ let's say you have 100 hostsã€‚ If the forks is set to 10ã€‚

 It's only going to execute against 10 host at a timeã€‚ and this numberï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 can be increased or decreased and really depend on your particular situationã€‚ And lastlyã€‚

 we have ansible manageï¼Œ which specifies a particular text to insert into templatesã€‚

 which indicate that the file is managed by ansible and the changes will be overwrittentã€‚

 And this is really useful so that other usersã€‚That certain files are controlled by ansible so that any changes that they make manually will not be permanent unless they actually update them in ansibleã€‚

 An example of this could be an httbd co fileã€‚ So user goes to make a change that file and doesn't realize that it's controlled by ansible and then the next time it runs then that configuration file is going to be overwritten by the template from Ansible Well that's going to finish up this overview of ansible configuration filesã€‚

 but there is one last thing I wanted to mention and that is that due to the way that our cloud playground image is configured we actually have to add an additional configuration which is Python underscore interpreter equals auto to our ansible cfgã€‚

 and the reason for this is that the repositories that are being used for these images do not have the Python2 DNf package availableã€‚

 and without that package our young module is going to failã€‚

 So setting the interpreter to auto is going to override the default of auto underscore legacyã€‚

 and that default actually uses the user bin Pythonã€‚

LiWwhich is using Python 2 and then auto is going to use user Liveec platform Pythonã€‚

 which is actually pointed to Python 3ã€‚ and we need to use that because the Python 3 DNF package does exist in our repoã€‚

In the futureï¼Œ Ansible is going to use auto by default over the auto underscore legacy settingã€‚

 So this helps to kind of future proof your installationã€‚

 as well as get rid of some warning messages when you run Ansibleã€‚

And let me just show you that configuration real quick so that you can add it to your own installation so you don't run into any problemsã€‚

 So I'm going to look at Etsy ansibleï¼Œ ansibleã€‚ cfgã€‚



![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_18.png)

And you can add this to the default ansibleã€‚ CFfg like I have right hereã€‚

 but whenever we create a new configuration fileï¼Œ you're going to need to make sure that you add it to that as wellã€‚

 And as you can seeï¼Œ this is just interpreterï¼Œ underscore Python equals autoã€‚



![](img/efccfba99df627e26a0383ace739c632_20.png)

Wellï¼Œ to finish out this lessonï¼Œ I just wanted to say that there are several configurations that you can make to the main Anible configuration fileã€‚

 and of course we can't go over all of themï¼Œ but we have touched on some of the more commonly used onesã€‚

And you have the Ansible dash config command at your disposal so you can look up all the various different configurations that you can makeã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ that's going to finish up this video and our section on understanding the core components of Ansibleã€‚

 Let's go ahead and mark it completeï¼Œ and we can move on to the next lessonã€‚
