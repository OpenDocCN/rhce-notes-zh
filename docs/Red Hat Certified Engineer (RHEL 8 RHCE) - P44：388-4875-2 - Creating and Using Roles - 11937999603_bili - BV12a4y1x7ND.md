# Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHEL 8 RHCE) - P44ï¼š388-4875-2 - Creating and Using Roles - 11937999603_bili - BV12a4y1x7ND

Welcome backï¼Œ everyoneã€‚ This is Mattã€‚ And in this videoã€‚

 we're going to continue our discussion on ansible rolesã€‚ And in the previous lessonã€‚

 we learned a little bit more about rolesã€‚ And in this lessonã€‚

 I'm going to show you how you can create a role and then also use it in your playbookã€‚

 So let's head over to section 10ã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_1.png)

And then down to creating and using rolesã€‚ So in the diagramã€‚

 I have provided just some examples of what I'm going to be doing in order to create this roleã€‚

 So let's head over to the command line and we can get startedã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_3.png)

And as you can seeï¼Œ I am in the roles directoryï¼Œ which is our newly defined directory for our ansible rolesã€‚

 Currentlyï¼Œ the only role that exists is a role called commonã€‚ And for this demonstrationã€‚

 we're going to create a role called Apache that is going to set up and configure some Apache HtTPD servers for usã€‚

 So the first thing that we need to do is create the directory structure for our roleã€‚

 and in order to do thisï¼Œ we need to use the ansible galaxy in knit commandã€‚

 So we're going to type in ansible galaxyã€‚A knit and then the name of our roleã€‚

 which is going to be Apacheã€‚And we get a message that Apache was created successfullyã€‚

 so now let's go ahead and do a listing on thatã€‚And we see that this skeletal directory structure has been set up for our new roleã€‚

 So now that we have our structureï¼Œ the first thing that we're going to do is create our taskã€‚

 and these need to be added in the main dot yamel of the task directoryã€‚

 Let's go ahead and C D into Apache taskã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_5.png)

And then we can open up the main dot yalã€‚And as you can seeã€‚

 the Ansible Galaxy and knit command created this main dot Yamlï¼Œ and it's just a simple fileã€‚

 it's going to start with three dashesï¼Œ lets us know that this is a Yaml fileã€‚

 and then just a short description which says taskask file for Apacheã€‚

So let's go ahead and add a new line and rather than you sitting and just watching me type through all these tasks of which there are severalã€‚

 I'm just going to copy it for my clipboardã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_7.png)

We'll head back to the topã€‚ Let's just make sure that the formatting seems okayã€‚

 which it does at first glanceã€‚ And now we can just walk through the different tasks that we're going to be performing with this roleã€‚

 So the first thing we're going to do is create a web content directoryã€‚ And for thatã€‚

 we're going to use the file moduleã€‚ And then for Paï¼Œ we're actually specifying a variableã€‚

 which I will show you in just a minuteã€‚ And this is going to be creating a directoryã€‚

 And then we're setting the mode to 0ï¼Œ7ï¼Œ5ï¼Œ5ã€‚And then on this directory that we're creatingã€‚

 which is called web contentï¼Œ we're going to set the SE contextã€‚

 so we're going to use the SEF context module and then for target we're going to use our variable once again and then SE type is going to be HTTPD assist content T and state is going to be presentã€‚

And then we're going to be running Restorecon on web contentã€‚

 So here we just have the restorestorecon command with dash RV and our Apache content directory variableã€‚

And then we're going to be installing Apache for that we're going to use the y moduleã€‚

 The name is HtTPDï¼Œ and then the state is latestã€‚And then we're going push out a couple templatesã€‚

 The first is the HttPã€‚ coã€‚ So we're going to use the template module and for sourceã€‚

 you're going to notice that I'm just listing the name of the template and I'm not specifying a relative path or an absolute pathã€‚

 and that's because as long as our templates are in our template directoryã€‚

 we can just specify the name we don't have to specify pathã€‚

 and then we're going specify the destination which is going to be the HttPDã€‚

 co file and I'm going to go ahead and perform a backup of thatã€‚

 and then we're also going to use the notify keyword in order to notify handler that will be creating momentarily Next we're going to deploy our index HTMLtml using the template moduleã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_9.png)

And notice that for a destinationï¼Œ I'm actually using the Apache content du variableã€‚

 and we're going to call the file indexã€‚ HTMLtmã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_11.png)

And then we're going to start and enable the HttPD serviceã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_13.png)

All rightï¼Œ let's go ahead and save and quit thisã€‚And before we move on to templates or handlersã€‚

 let's go ahead and set up our variablesã€‚So I'm going to see the into the defaults directoryã€‚

And this is the location that we can set our default variablesã€‚

And I'm going to open up the main dot Yalã€‚We can add a new lineã€‚And hereã€‚

 all we're going to do is specify our variablesã€‚ So I'll go ahead and copyã€‚And I can paste these inã€‚

And as you can see we are specifying three different variablesï¼Œ we have Apache content Duã€‚

 which is slash web content and then Apache HttP portï¼Œ which is going to be 8080ã€‚

 and then Apache adminï¼Œ which is going to be cloud user So now that these variables have been definedã€‚

 we can reference them anywhere within our roleï¼Œ So let's go ahead and save and quit thisã€‚

Now I'm going to seed into the templates directoryã€‚And as you can seeã€‚

 we don't have any template files yetã€‚ and againï¼Œ for sake of timeã€‚

 I went ahead and created these templatesï¼Œ and for many of youã€‚

 these are going to be very familiar from our Apache template demonstrationã€‚

 Let's go ahead and copy these from home cloud user Ansible templatesã€‚Then we have httPdã€‚comã€‚j2ã€‚

So go ahead and copy that as well as the index dot HTMLã€‚Now let's go ahead and open up the HttPdã€‚comã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_15.png)

As you can seeï¼Œ this is very similar to the template that we used in a prior demonstrationã€‚

But as you can seeï¼Œ I've added the namespace variableï¼Œ so we have Apache HtTP portã€‚

And then Apache admin here for the server adminã€‚And then for the document routeã€‚

 we're using Apache content duã€‚ All rightï¼Œ let's go ahead and quit out of thisã€‚

 And then just brieflyï¼Œ we can open up the index dot Hmã€‚

 And this is going to remain relatively unchanged since we're using the variables that were gathered by ansible factsã€‚

 All rightï¼Œ so we'll go ahead and quit out of thatã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_17.png)

And before we move onï¼Œ I did want to show you that I have these examples within the diagramã€‚

 so we have great tasksã€‚ It's going to be all the tasks that we're usingã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_19.png)

And then we have create variablesã€‚And then it create templatesã€‚

 and here's the example of the index do Htm and also the HttPd do comã€‚ And then on the next pageã€‚

 I have create handlers and finally create playbookã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_21.png)

So let's head back over the command line and we can create the handlers and then we can actually run our role in a playbookã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_23.png)

So clear this outã€‚If I can spell it correctlyã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_25.png)

And then we're going to see D into handlersã€‚We'll see our pre generatedrated mainã€‚ Yalã€‚

Let's go ahead and grab our handler from our clipboardã€‚And as you can seeã€‚

 the name of our handler is restart web serversï¼Œ we're going to be using the service moduleã€‚

 the name is HttPD and the state is restartedï¼Œ and we're going to be listening for that notify keywordã€‚

 which is restart Apacheã€‚So let's go ahead and save and quit thisã€‚

 Now let's see the back a couple directoriesã€‚Maybe one more and then into our playbooks directoryã€‚

And now we're going to create a playbook in order to run this roleã€‚

 So let's just call this roll dot Ylã€‚Start with our three dashes and then hostã€‚

 we're going to be executing this against the web server hostã€‚

Since we're running some privilege commandsï¼Œ we need to set that become to be yesã€‚

Now there's a couple different ways that we can reference our role within our playbookã€‚

 and that's why I've provided a couple different examples in the diagramã€‚

 So one way is to specify the roles keywordã€‚And then we can come under here and we could just type in the name of our rollã€‚

 which is Apacheã€‚ and if we saved and quit and then ran thisï¼Œ it would pull in our rollã€‚

 and that would also pull in all our tasks and our handlers and variables and templatesã€‚

 and then it would execute our rollã€‚But we can also specify role and then a colon and then the name of our rollã€‚

Should be Apacheï¼Œ and you could also use the include roll keyword and then specify the name of the rollã€‚

 as you see at the bottom of the diagramã€‚ But let's just go ahead and save it as it isã€‚

And before we run that playbookï¼Œ let's head over to MSã€‚ Pearson 3Cã€‚

 which is one of the two servers in our Web servers groupã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_27.png)

Firstï¼Œ I just wanted to do a listingï¼Œ showed that the web content directory has not been createdã€‚

And then alsoï¼Œ we can do a pseudo yum list installedã€‚And then Grep for HttPDã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_29.png)

And we see that the service is not installedï¼Œ so let's head back to our control nodeã€‚

 and now we can kick off our playbookã€‚Soll be Antsible playbookã€‚And then roll dot Yamlã€‚

And this may take a little whileï¼Œ so I'll go ahead and speed this up so you don't have to sit and waitã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_31.png)

And we see that just by specifying our role in the playbookã€‚

 it pulled in all the tasks that we define and executed themã€‚

 So let's scroll up and we can just walk through that real quick so we gather our factsã€‚

 and then we create our web content directoryã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_33.png)

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_34.png)

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_35.png)

And then we set the Se context on that directoryã€‚Nextï¼Œ we run restorestoreconã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_37.png)

And then install Apacheã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_39.png)

And then we push out our two templatesï¼Œ httbdã€‚com and indexã€‚htmã€‚

 and then finally we start and enable the HttBD serviceã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_41.png)

And lastly you're going to see running handlerï¼Œ and that's because we had a change to the Apache configuration file and we said notify the handler whenever that happensã€‚

 so it went ahead and restarted our web serversã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_43.png)

So let's head over to MS Pearson 3 just to validate our changesã€‚

So go ahead and clear that first we'll see if our web content directory was createdã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_45.png)

And it wasã€‚ Let's make sure that the context is correctã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_47.png)

And that is set to HttbD cis contentã€‚We can run a system CTL statusï¼Œ H TTBDã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_49.png)

And we see that our service was installedï¼Œ enabledï¼Œ and is up and runningã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_51.png)

Now let's make sure our indexã€‚ HTML was deployedã€‚And it wasã€‚

 and let's go ahead and open up the EtsyttbDtbã€‚com fileã€‚

And we see that our template was pushed out and all our variables were updated with the appropriate valuesã€‚



![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_53.png)

Let's go ahead and quit out of hereï¼Œ and we're going to head back to our control nodeã€‚

Let's just try a simple curlã€‚On MSParson 3C on port 880ã€‚And we see that we get our index do HTMLã€‚

Wellï¼Œ we validated that our role is executing successfullyï¼Œ but before we finishã€‚

 I wanted to show you one last thingã€‚So let's open up our playbook one more timeã€‚

And I'm going to show you how you can add a variable here in the playbook and how that is going to override the default variable that you put in your defaults directoryã€‚

So let's add another line and at the same level as ruleï¼Œ we're going to add in vrsã€‚

And then we're going to specify our variable nameã€‚ And for this exampleã€‚

 let's just go ahead and update the Apache port so it's going to be Apache underscore HttPã€‚

Underscore portï¼Œ and we're going to set that to be 80 rather than 8080ã€‚

So let's go ahead and save and quitï¼Œ and then we can kick off our playbook againã€‚

And I'll go ahead and speed this upã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_55.png)

And now that that's finishedï¼Œ one thing that you'll notice is that the handler was notified againã€‚

 and that's because we updated the httPdã€‚com fileã€‚ So now let's clear this out and go ahead and try to run our curl againã€‚

 So Emmas Pearson 3C first let's try it on 8080ã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_57.png)

As you can seeï¼Œ we get a connection refusedã€‚Let'll see what happens when we try to hit it on 80ã€‚

And as expectedï¼Œ we'd get our indexã€‚ HTMLã€‚Just to further validate thatã€‚

 let's go ahead and open up our HttPã€‚com fileã€‚

![](img/9168d8cd67d2ca9fa21312e9b23df99d_59.png)

And we see that our listen port is now set at 80ã€‚Wellã€‚

 that's going to finish up this video on creating and using rolesã€‚

 so let's go ahead and market Comp and we can move on to the next sectionã€‚
