Now， after we have configured IPV6 on both of our machines。

 I would like to show you some of the commands， which are slightly different from the regular IP command。

So if I want to show the IP address on this machine， which is version 6。

 I'll type in IPspace hyphen 6 or dash 6。

Addres。And instead of showing me all the interfaces， it'll only show the interface。

 it'll showing glue back as well as the interface， which has the IPV 6 address configured。

 which is this one right here that we configured earlier。Okay， and another useful command。

 It's kind of similar to Cisco's CDP command。 if you're familiar with that。

 it shows the neighbors that are connected to this one device so。If I do this。So one。

 there are some other ones also， but the ones that I'm interested in is our other machine。

That we configure， because it has。A field of five at the end。 So it's showing that as a neighbor。

Another command is to view IPV6 connections to local interfaces。
