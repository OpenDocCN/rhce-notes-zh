Welcome back everyoneï¼Œ this is Mattï¼Œ and in this video we're going to finish up our discussion on Antsible roles and talk a little bit about Antsible Galaxyã€‚

So let's head over to next sections and then section 10ã€‚And then finally down to Anspo Galaxyã€‚

So Ansible Galaxy is just a large public repository for downloading and sharing community developed rolesã€‚

 So rather than having to create a role from scratchã€‚

 you can just check out Ansible galaxyax and then see if anyone else has already done the legwork for youã€‚

 So basically don't reinvent the wheelã€‚ And you can always install a roll from galaxy and then modify it to meet your specific needsã€‚

 And then we have the ansible galaxyaxy command line utilityã€‚

 which is going to allow us to create and remove roles or to install roles from Ansible Galaxy or get based SCmã€‚

 which is software configuration managementã€‚ And this is going to be our main means of interacting with ansible galaxy from the command lineã€‚

 It has several subcommandsï¼Œ you can see here in the syntaxã€‚

 And there are also going to be several additional optionsã€‚ that subcommans are going to takeã€‚

 So if you take a look at the syntaxï¼Œ you're going to specify Ansible dash galaxyã€‚

 And then one the subcomds from delete import all the way to set upã€‚

 And then you're going to specify your additional optionsã€‚

 And now let's set over to the next page and we're going to walk through some of these different subcommands and what they doã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo firstï¼Œ we have the init subcommanï¼Œ which we've already seen in the previous videoã€‚

 and this is going to build out the basic directory structure of the roleã€‚

 so you don't have to go through and create every file and directoryã€‚ You doï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 have the option to do this manuallyï¼Œ but using the init subcom is going to make this very easy for youã€‚

 Nextï¼Œ we have the search subcommanï¼Œ which is going to take a keyword and then optionally an authorã€‚

 and this is going to search through Ansible galaxy using the information that you've providedã€‚

 And like I saidï¼Œ the author name is optionalã€‚ but depending on the keyword that you selectã€‚

 you can get a ton of different outputã€‚ So having the author name is very handyã€‚Nextã€‚

 we have the install Subcomï¼Œ which is very important because it's going to actually install the roles on the control node for usã€‚

 The role provided can be a name which will then be downloaded via the Galax API and Gitthubã€‚

 or it can also be a local TG Z fileã€‚ And when specifying a role from Gitthubã€‚

 you will typically use the author name a period and then the name of the rollã€‚

 And in addition to installing role from galaxyï¼Œ you can also install a roll from a fileã€‚

 And to do thisï¼Œ you're going toï¼Œ again specify Ansible Galaxy installã€‚

 and then the dash R option and then the name of the fileã€‚ Nextã€‚

 you can list install roles using Ansible Galax listã€‚

 and also print additional information about the installed roles using Ansible Gal infoã€‚

 And then finally remove a roll using ansible Galaxy removeã€‚All rightã€‚

 so now that we talked about some of the subcommans for Ansible Galaxyã€‚

 let's head over to our browser and we can walk through the Ansible Galaxy websiteã€‚



![](img/4d279c5a4bc9170a2c21384958adb272_1.png)

So on the homeageï¼Œ you'll see the navigation on the left right hereã€‚We're currently on the home pageã€‚

 but there is a search pageã€‚We're just going to provide a search bar in order for you to search for particular rolesã€‚

 and then we also have the community tabã€‚And out of thisã€‚

 you're going to see a list of community authorsï¼Œ as well as the amount of roles that they have contributedã€‚

 Of courseï¼Œ you can filter this and search through itã€‚ And now let's head back to the home pageã€‚

 and you're going to see several different categories of the most popular content like systems and networkingã€‚

But let's go ahead and click on databaseã€‚And this is going to show you some of the most popular roles that have the database tagã€‚

 which you'll see right hereã€‚ And right here at the topã€‚

 we see MimCched is the most popular currently followed by MySqLã€‚ And just like the search tabã€‚

 this page is also going to provide a search option as wellã€‚ But for this videoã€‚

 we're actually going to be using the Postgres SQL role that's provided by gearling guyã€‚So you seeã€‚

 this is like the fifth downã€‚So you're going to see the name of the role on the right and then the author on the leftã€‚

 let's go ahead and click on thatã€‚And that's going to take us to a page for the role and give us a little information about the roleã€‚

 such as when it was last committed some version information as well as supported operating system and here in the top rightã€‚

 there's even a link to the GitHub repo and if we click on thatã€‚

It takes us straight to the repositoryã€‚We can also gain a little more information about what is going on with this particular roleã€‚

 All rightï¼Œ So now let's head back to our other screenã€‚



![](img/4d279c5a4bc9170a2c21384958adb272_3.png)

And then we can try out some of these Ansible Gal commands and ultimately install this PostresqL roleã€‚

Alrightï¼Œ so the first thing Im want to do is just Cd into ansible rolesã€‚

And this is my main roles directoryã€‚So currently we just have the Apache rule that we created in the last video and then the common roleã€‚

 So now let's go ahead and search Ansible Galaxy using Ansible Galaxyã€‚Searchã€‚

 and then we can provide our keywordï¼Œ which is going to be Postgresqlã€‚And if you look at the topã€‚

 it finds 559 roles that are matching our search keywordã€‚

 and on the left we're going to have the name of the roleã€‚

 which is going to be the author and then a dot and then the actual name of the roleã€‚

 and then there's going to be a description here on the right so that's going to tell us a little more about each roleã€‚

And you may have also noticed that the name of the ruleã€‚

 which again starts with the author name firstï¼Œ is going to be listed in alphabetical orderã€‚

So let's go ahead and quit out of this with Qã€‚And now let's search for the author that we're looking forã€‚

 which is gear Ling Guã€‚And we see that we find two roles that are matching our search criteriaã€‚

And the first role provides PP Postgresql support for Linuxã€‚

 and the second is the Postgresql server for Linuxã€‚And let's go ahead and copy this role nameã€‚

And then we can install the roll using Ansible Galaxyã€‚Install and then the name of our ruleã€‚

 which is gearlingguã€‚ post rescueculã€‚And we see that we get some information about the action that the Ansple Galaxy command is takingã€‚

 so it downloads the roleï¼Œ tells you where it's getting it fromã€‚

 and then ultimately it's extracting it in Etsy Ansipible rolls gearing guyã€‚

 and then it's also extracting it to home cloud user Ansipible rolesã€‚

 So let's go ahead and do a listingã€‚And we see the directory for our rollï¼Œ so let's CDd into thatã€‚

And then if we do a listing of this directoryï¼Œ we see the expected roll directory structureã€‚

 which was extracted from the roll that we just installedã€‚

 And one really important file when you're installing roles from Ansible Galaxy is going to be read meã€‚

Let's go ahead and open that upã€‚And this is going to give us additional information about the role as well as how to use itã€‚

And then you see here at the bottomï¼Œ it's going to give you an example of how to run it in a playbookã€‚

So just make sure that you check out this readme fileã€‚

 especially for roles that you're installing from Ansipible galaxyaxy that you're not quite as familiar withã€‚

 And that way you can see if there's any additional configuration that's required and ultimately just how to use the rollã€‚

 All rightï¼Œ let's go ahead and quit out of thisã€‚Now let's try out the Ansipible Galaxy list subcommandã€‚

And so this is going to show us our roles directoryï¼Œ which is currently set to Etsy Ansible rolesã€‚

 as well as home Cloud user Ansible rolesï¼Œ and then a list of the installed rolesã€‚

 so we're going to have common Apache in then our recent gearlingguã€‚ postreqL roleã€‚

And then we can also gain more information about a role by typing an Ansible galaxy and then info and then the name of the rollã€‚

 So this is going to beã€‚Gearinggu do postreqlã€‚And this will show us information like when the role was createdã€‚

 the download countï¼Œ the GitHub repoï¼Œ the GitHub userï¼Œ and also when it was last modifiedã€‚

 And then to quit out of thisï¼Œ we can just take Qã€‚And then if we'd like to remove a rollã€‚

 all we have to do is type in Ansible Galaxyã€‚Remove and then the name of our roleã€‚

 which is gearingG dot postgsqLã€‚And even though we've installed this roleã€‚

 it's telling us that the roll is not installedã€‚ So it's skipping itã€‚

 And the reason for this is the way that we have our roll path parameter and our ansible CFG configuredã€‚

 So let's go ahead and open that up real quickã€‚ It's going to be at home and then dot ansible dot CGã€‚

So even though we have two roles path specified for some reasonã€‚

 Ansible' is going to initiate look in Etsy Ansible rolesã€‚ And when it doesn't see the roleã€‚

 it's not going to move on to home cloud user ansible rolesã€‚ Andï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 this is a bit frustratingã€‚ But one way that we can rectify this is by just copying thisã€‚

And just putting it on the other sideã€‚So rather than starting with Etsy Ansible rolesã€‚

 let's start with our home cloud user Ansible rolesã€‚And then we could add Ean rolls to the endã€‚

All rightï¼Œ let's go ahead and save and quitï¼Œ and then we can try our remove one more timeã€‚

And we see that we were able to successfully remove our roleã€‚Wellã€‚

 that's going to finish up this video in Ansible Galaxyã€‚

 so go ahead and mark it Comp and we can move on to the next sectionã€‚
