# [FreeCourseSite.com] Udemy - Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) - 2018 - P30Ôºö6. Firewall rich rules--3. NAT and port forwarding - ÊàëÂêÉÂç∞Â∫¶È£ûÈ•º - BV1jJ411S76a

So in this lectureÔºå we're going to talk about Net or network address translation net can be done with firewall D with either masquerading or pork forwarding„ÄÇ

 both of which can be configured with Firewall D Firewall CMD command„ÄÇ

 It is important to note that masquerading can only be done with IPV4 and not IPV 6„ÄÇSo first„ÄÇ

 we going to discuss masquerading with firewall D masquerading with forward packets that are not directed to an I address associated to the system itself On to the intended destination„ÄÇ

The source IP address of the packets that are sent through our system„ÄÇ

Will be changed to the IP address of our system rather than the IP address of the original traffic source„ÄÇ

Responses to these packets will then go through our system and the destination address will be modified so that the traffic will be sent back to the original host that initiated the traffic„ÄÇ

Masquerad can be enabled on a zone with the use of dash dashÔºå add masquerade„ÄÇDirective„ÄÇ

 so this saw you do itÔºå Firewall„ÄÇThere is CMD„ÄÇDashÔºå dash„ÄÇPermanent„ÄÇDash dash zone„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇTesting„ÄÇ

Dash dashÔºå add„ÄÇDash masquerade„ÄÇKÔºå it's been added successfully„ÄÇ

 We can confirm that the masquerading has been successfully enabled with dash dash query„ÄÇ

 dash masquerade„ÄÇ In this caseÔºå we want to query the permanent configuration as this is what to be modified„ÄÇ

 and we have not yet performed a reload yet„ÄÇ So firewall„ÄÇüòäÔºåThat is CMD„ÄÇDashÔºå dash permanent„ÄÇ

Dash dash query„ÄÇDash masquerade„ÄÇSo so farÔºå it says no„ÄÇ

So we're going to use an example in which any packet sent to an address defined in the zone testing will be masqueraded„ÄÇ

Rich rules can be used for more granular„ÄÇControl„ÄÇSoÔºå firewall„ÄÇThere CMD„ÄÇDash dash permanent„ÄÇ

Dash dash his own„ÄÇEquals testing„ÄÇDash just add„ÄÇDash rich rule„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇRu„ÄÇFamily„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇIPV 4„ÄÇSource„ÄÇ

Address„ÄÇEquals 1Ôºå92 dot 1Ôºå68 dot 1 dot0Ôºå slash„ÄÇ24„ÄÇMasquerade„ÄÇOkayÔºå success„ÄÇSo in this example„ÄÇ

 anything coming from the sourceÔºå 192168„ÄÇ1„ÄÇ0/24 specifically will be masqueraded„ÄÇ

Now we're going to talk about port forwarding with firewallD as the name implies pour forwarding with forward all traffic destined to a specific port to either a different port on the local system or to some port on an external system„ÄÇ

 not that if you are forwarding to an external system„ÄÇ

 you'll also need to enable masquerading as covered before„ÄÇ

In the example below the local system will forward all traffic sent to port 22 to 10„ÄÇ0„ÄÇ0„ÄÇ

10 colon 2222Ôºå so any traffic sent to this server on port 22 will be forwarded to the external system 10„ÄÇ

0„ÄÇ0„ÄÇ10 on TCP 2222 In this instance the port forwarding rule will only apply to sources specific in the test zone„ÄÇ

Cancecil„ÄÇFirewall dash CD„ÄÇDashÔºå dashÔºå permanent„ÄÇDash dash zone„ÄÇEquals testing„ÄÇDashÔºå dashÔºå add„ÄÇ

Dash forward„ÄÇDashport„ÄÇEquals port„ÄÇEquals 22„ÄÇKolin„ÄÇProtocol„ÄÇEquals TCP„ÄÇKolen„ÄÇüòîÔºå2„ÄÇPoorrk„ÄÇEquals2Ôºå2Ôºå2Ôºå2„ÄÇ

Ken„ÄÇüòîÔºåTo address„ÄÇEquals 10 dot 0 do 0 do 10„ÄÇOkay successful„ÄÇ

 we can perform that mass grading we can confirm that mass grading has been successfully enabled with the use of query„ÄÇ

D dash queryÔºå dash forward dash port„ÄÇOkayÔºå which will be„ÄÇZone testing„ÄÇSoÔºå I'm gonna„ÄÇ

Delete part of it„ÄÇUp to here„ÄÇ we are fine„ÄÇAnd then I'm going to do dash dash„ÄÇQurry„ÄÇDash forward„ÄÇPor„ÄÇ

Equals port„ÄÇEquals 22 colon„ÄÇProto„ÄÇEquals TCP„ÄÇHolen„ÄÇüòîÔºåTo port„ÄÇEquals2Ôºå2Ôºå2Ôºå2„ÄÇKowwen„ÄÇTo address„ÄÇ

Equals 10 dot 0 dot0 dot10„ÄÇIt says yes„ÄÇIs being confirmed„ÄÇ

This doesn't seem to be that useful as it only seems to match if you put in the full entry that was used when adding the port forwarder„ÄÇ

 a better option is to use dash dash list dash all as we have demonstrated previously as this will show any forwarded ports„ÄÇ

 so that command would be firewall„ÄÇTheres CMD„ÄÇDashÔºå dash permanent„ÄÇDash dash list„ÄÇDash all„ÄÇ

Dash dash zone„ÄÇ

Equals testing„ÄÇOkayÔºå here you can see of a forwarded port„ÄÇ

This is also another way of seeing if masquerading has been enabled„ÄÇ

 which rules can be can again be used for more granular control„ÄÇ

 so in this instance we can specify a specific source address within the test zone rather than the whole zone„ÄÇ

And the way we do it is„ÄÇWhere we have source address„ÄÇOne does your„ÄÇWe can also„ÄÇAfter the address„ÄÇ

Let make sure that I have the rest of the command correctly„ÄÇFamily IPV4 source address 192168„ÄÇ

And then after thatÔºå we're going to increase the we're going to„ÄÇ

We're going to add on or the rest of our command here„ÄÇBy typing in forward„ÄÇPoor„ÄÇPoor„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇ22„ÄÇ

Ptocol„ÄÇEquals TCP„ÄÇ2„ÄÇüòîÔºåPoor„ÄÇEquals 2Ôºå2Ôºå2Ôºå2„ÄÇ2„ÄÇAddres„ÄÇEquals 10„ÄÇDot zeroÔºå dot zeroÔºå dot10„ÄÇ

And end of codeÔºå and then I'm going to delete the rest of it„ÄÇ

successful and also we can use the optional2 address parametermeter in which case the port forwarding will take place entirely on local host„ÄÇ

 We can view the rich rules in place with the dash dash listÔºå dash rich dash rules„ÄÇSo firewall„ÄÇ

Theres CMD„ÄÇDash dashÔºå permanent„ÄÇDash dash zone„ÄÇEquals„ÄÇTesting„ÄÇDashÔºå dash list„ÄÇDash„ÄÇRich„ÄÇRuleles„ÄÇ



![](img/b326f02d9ba37e65259c325075a12b35_7.png)

And these are rituals„ÄÇSo by using the Firewall CMD command we have been able to create basic rules in Firewall D as well as rich rules with very specific custom options„ÄÇ

 we have also been able to make use of masquerading and port forwarding in order to send traffic elsewhere by performingNe„ÄÇ
